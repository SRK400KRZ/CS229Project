Hi all,

Let's say I have a hollow tube with a rope wound around it, one end of the rope is fixed and I pull on the other end of the rope, this will tension the rope around the tube (which can't rotate). This tension will then exert pressure on the tube surface.

If the tube wall is too thin, it will buckle. How would I go about calculating the minimum wall thickness of the tube for a certain rope tension, so that it won't fail?

I'm familiar with the Eytelwein equation and am also curious if/how this problem relates to it.

Thanks in advance!

How common is EMI issues on spaceships and is it something that is a easy fix?  Reason I ask is recently Virgin Galactic’s VSS unity had a EMI issue that resulted in the aborted December flight and February flight.  They plan to fly in May, but is that even possible with a EMI issue?

I currently manage 7 hotels and an RV park. We are looking to replace the old meraki APs that are around the RV park but I've never done an RV park Wifi setup. The hotels are all Unifi gear (before my time) so I was looking to maybe do something similar to the RV park but figured I would do my due diligence and look for other options. I have two buildings in the park, one in the top left corner and one in more or less the middle. I have hardline to those two buildings but not to anywhere else around the site. I understand that it would be best to hardline everything but that just isn't something I can do at the moment. I have power available everywhere on site.  


My plan was to use maybe 4 Unifi mesh pros handlined with two on both buildings on opposite sides. Then place maybe 4-6 mesh (non pro) around the park to work as a mesh system.   


The park is around 100 spots fairly tightly packed. I have 600/35 coming in.  


Any other tips or companies I should look into for my APs?

Is there a way, or an RFC to catch some exceptions EXCEPT some other exceptions?

&amp;#x200B;

Something like this:

    try {...}
    catch (Throwable ^ LogicException $e) { ... }

Instead of this:

    try {... }
    catch (LogicException $e) { throw $e; } // Seems redundant
    catch (Throwable $e) { ... }

Where `LogicException` is a child class of the `Throwable` class.
