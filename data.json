        "2": "It's all started back in the 2014... It was then that I got the idea to make the game of my dreams. But at that time I had no experience, so I had to start from scratch. Programming, animation, visuals - all this had to be mastered in free time from the main work, including weekends. After six months of \u201cintensive training\u201d, I realized that it was definitely not possible to carry out the idea alone. I began to browse thematic forums and look for like-minded people, along the way continuing to improve my own skill. \n\n*First concepts -* [*https://imgur.com/Rj6F9aP*](https://imgur.com/Rj6F9aP)\n\nAt first I tried to find the same enthusiasts as me, but disputes and disagreements began that only hurt the game (unexpectedly, huh?). \n\n***Lesson 1: Be prepared to make compromises or prepare for a quick loss of interest in the project of other developers if you defend your vision of the game, but you have nothing to pay.***\n\nSo it became necessary to turn to professionals, which means it was necessary to look for funding. I prepared documentation, concepts and started looking for an investor. I sent hundreds of letters to successful businessmen in social networks. And a group of wealthy young people became interested in the game. They were ready to finance the project, but made a condition that I must find a full-fledged development team. The negotiations took about two months. During this time, a programmer, animator and artist was found.   \n\n\nAnd then something happened.  Many would not be surprised, but for a beginner in the gaming industry it was a shock. They called me and said: \n\n&gt;\u201cWell, now you have a team, well done. And we consulted again and decided that we did not want to invest yet.\u201d \n\nI was very surprised, because all this time we communicated positively, and it seemed that they would agree... but life turned out to be cruel :)  \n\n\n***Lesson 2: When concluding any important agreements, always draw up official documentation that you can use if something happens. Even if you are \"in a very good relationship.\"***\n\nAs my try to get funding failed miserably, I loaned bank money to pay salaries and proceed with the development. I hoped that it will be way easier to find funding with at least some parts of the future game at hand. Unfortunately, there were not much to show anyone at early stage of the development. Unfortunately, there has been little progress at this stage. Some specialists did not always understand the technical tasks, which I set and did in their own way, so there were a lot of \u2018re-dos\u2019 and delays. \n\n*The first options for the appearance of the character   -*[*https://imgur.com/L8WbYH3*](https://imgur.com/L8WbYH3)\n\n***Lesson 3: learn to immediately set specific, understandable and detailed requirements for the task being performed. It's better to spend time explaining at the beginning than reworking later.***\n\nOn the other hand that was when the team realized \u2013 3D is a must. There are too many animations for every character and it\u2019s easier with the polygon modeling as you don\u2019t have to draw every single frame and it saves a lot of time with the pre-made animations.\n\n***Lesson 4: if you want more lively and detailed animations in your game, then think about 3D at the start, this greatly simplifies the process.***\n\nAlong the way, I kept looking a new investor. With the early pre-alfa version \u2018The Forging Destiny HROFT\u2019 we started a crowdfunding campaign at Boomstarter.\n\nThere were no big hopes about this platform, but the we wanted to test the crowdfunding mechanics anyway. All in all the project raised just about $250 out of the projected $15\u00a0000. There was a good thing though \u2013 the new investor expressed a desire to fund the project if they cut the budget. This was their only option so they had to agree to this term. With this funding we finished the first game build and designed a lot of 3D-models (most of which are still in the game).  \n\nAs time went by, the team ran out of money and we had to cease the development. No one believed at this point that they could ever release the title. All of my staff told me that if I want to do something right, I have to learn how to do it by myself. That to create a game of this level I have to master programming, animation and stuff. Obviously that wasn\u2019t the goal for just 3 or 4 years.  Not to mention other development tasks needed to be done. Sure, I could have started with something less complicated but this game was the only thing I could think about! I still didn't want to compromise xD\n\nMeanwhile the game\u2019s community was growing rapidly. The gamers saw that despite all odds I didn\u2019t give up and just kept working. Some of them (designer, animation designer and programmer) even joined the team without any pay! The gameplay as well as the most of the characters and the narrative had been revised and the game changed its name to **A.S.H. (About Savior Hunter)**.\n\n***Lesson 5: Even if it is very difficult, but you see that there is a chance - try and continue. Sometimes fate also brings positive surprises.***\n\nWhile pursuing my dream I made some desperate decisions \u2013 sold my car to pay for a motion capture studio to make character moves look as real as possible. First try was a failure, though. The studio didn\u2019t even considered the reference moves I provided them with, so I decided to take a train to Moscow (I live in Archangelsk, over 620 miles from there) get into the mocap suit and capture all the character moves he needed in the exact way he wants them to look like. \n\nIt had never happened to me before. As I was practicing the moves before the capture session I stretched my leg so hard that I barely could walk. They told me it could take up about 10 days to recover but my mocap session was in two days. I could not reschedule it everything was already arranged and paid. With some painkillers I had managed to get there and after the 5 hours of motion capture (and pain!) we somehow recorded all the moves I wanted.\n\n *After long hours of waving a stick -*  [*https://imgur.com/a1mGFYQ*](https://imgur.com/a1mGFYQ)\n\nAfter a while, we gave crowdfunding another chance and started a new campaign. Only this time - on Kickstarter. Lack of the marketing caused another failure despite the title raised more than a $1000 in pledges. It didn\u2019t help much though, and the team broke up again seeing their goals unachievable. Once again I had to find an investor to resume the development. And after a couple of months I found one. On a strict condition that I had to gather a new team and find a publisher first. Finding a publisher was quite a challenge and yet I somehow pulled it off. And yet It's all has been for nothing \u2013 after a week the investor informed me that they are not going to support my project.\n\nAt some point my family pushed me pretty hard to drop this project as I put way too much effort into it with little avail. Well, there was some progress in development, but it definitely wasn\u2019t enough. I started to realize that something pushes investors away so I had to find a common ground with them\u2026\n\n***Lesson 6: Do not forget about lesson 2 and if you see that people are not very interested in your game, stop and try to find out what exactly pushes gamers and investors away.***\n\nI continued to post information about the game on hundreds of sites in search of investors. Requests came from different countries, they say \"your game is very interesting to us\", but after a couple of weeks the investors disappeared. By this time I began to approach the issue of discussing investing much more seriously and after about couple of months of he negotiations the contract had been signed and development was on again. I could finally gather a team of professionals to develop a playable game build I would be proud of. With two new programmers, level-designer, animation designer and two part-time 3D-modelers. \n\nFor the next 2 months, intensive work was also carried out with the composer and sound engineer. Actually, all team members are contract workers implementing the game designer ideas for a salary. In so doing, they are did their best. Ludus Future team worked about 12-16 hours a day and sometimes willingly on weekends (everything, of course, was paid and no one was forced to work). I don't like the word \"studio\", as I find it too formal, and I still like to think that my team is more about friendship, despite the fact that all team members live in different regions of Russia.\n\nAfter six months of hard work, we got a new build called Demon Skin. I actively communicated with the team and listened to the opinions of other people, and as a result, the game's plot changed, as well as the main character. We sent Demon Skin to DevGAMM Online event and UEDC-2020. \n\n*The final look of the game -* [*https://imgur.com/dDDnOxM*](https://imgur.com/dDDnOxM)\n\nNow Demon Skin\u00a0is 3D platform game with RPG elements mainly focused on the melee combat. And I still finds its melee combat system the best one i know in this genre (inspired mostly by Severance: Blade of Darkness). I literally put my soul into the combat system xD\n\nIn short, there are three combat stances players should use in combat. By changing mouse directions you can target the head, torso and legs of the enemy. Switch stances timely to avoid attacks. With each new level you unlock spectacular and powerful combos. You should always pay attention to your stamina \u2013 if it is too low your attack gets way slower. \n\nInitially we intended the character to be fully powerless at the beginning just as it was in Severance: Blade of Darkness, but that wasn\u2019t met with the approval of our community. We have also designed a system of additional attacks to appear randomly during the combat. As the stance indication lights up blue \u2013 you can quickly select and perform this attack. It won\u2019t add you any damage, but it will buy you a few seconds to perform a super attack.  \n\n\n**RESULTS**\n\nAnd now, after almost 7 years of blood and sweat, life lessons and overcoming I finally finished my game and today it will be released on Steam ([https://store.steampowered.com/app/1522140/Demon\\_Skin/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1522140/Demon_Skin/)). I learned a lot, I managed to find investors at different stages of development, a team of professionals, and also bring the game to the point of \"finished product\". In just a few weeks, it will become clear which decisions during development were winning and which ones were not very good. I will learn new lessons and if it interests you, I will share them here :) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*P.S. Wish me luck and feel free to ask questions, the text came out a lot, so I did not go into small details. Today I will prepare for the release, but I promise to answer as soon as I have some free time.* ***Believe in yourself, never give up and you will achieve your goals!

        "17": "New to reddit, not sure if this is the right place, but it sounded like the group I would want to ask I guess.\n\nI'm trying to figure out how you would calculate number of ACTIVE players (played in the last 2 weeks seems reasonable to call active, though I'm sure there are plenty of reasons to agree or disagree, I am more concerned with the math than the definition of active, especially given this is outside the context of a specific game) from the Steam Spy data that is not restricted access. \n\nThe best I came up with was using the average time played, the average number of players on at any given time, from their 2 weeks chart. So if a game had an average of 10,000 players on at any given time, and the average player played for 4.5 hours over 2 weeks, would you then extrapolate that 2 weeks is 336 hours, divided by the 4.5 hour average, times the average number of players on at any given time? From the example with 336 hours in 2 weeks\n\n10,000 (336 / 4.5) = 746,666.6\n\nso if the equation is right, I would think about 746,000 people played in the last 2 weeks. To say that if 10,000 people played for 4.5 hours, with 74.6 of those 4.5 hour chunks available then you would have available number of slots times the number of people occupying a slot at a given moment, even if their specific slots do not align with each other. Obviously for professional use, you would want a lot more data, but for a general current snapshot, is this a sufficient equation or am I missing something obvious (as I am prone to doing)",

I'm still in University and currently building out my portfolio of games that I have made (currently 4). I was wondering if maybe I should focus more on individual gameplay programming and publishing that instead of a full game that can be played from start to finish in about 30 mins. Like for example, I code out a gameplay experience like shooting or a little hack and slash demo with cool collisions and animations.\n\nThe reason why I ask is because coding out a whole game would also involve things that won't necessarily involve gameplay programming such as level design. I just want to be as efficient as possible with my time and I just had a thought that maybe coding small gameplay experiences in a small \"gray boxed\" world to showcase my skills might be efficient. But I can also see the value in making a whole game as well.\n\nAnyone have any advice / created a portfolio using gameplay examples before?",

        "41": "Hello everyone, I am a hobbyist game developer and my real life profession is mechanical engineering. In the past, I have played and been inspired by naval games like **Pirates, Seadogs, Pirates of the Burning Sea, Black Flag** and **Naval Action** and at some point, I ambitiously decided to make my own ship combat game in Unity. And looking from a broad perspective, I actually quite liked the experience itself, while learning new stuff in coding, rendering, animating VFX and playing around with SFX.\n\nAfter some struggle and a steep learning phase, I finally end up having a basic prototype with a fundamental environment, ships and more importantly, a sailing model close to and depending on real-life physics. This is actually the point, where I think I have come across to a fork in a road.\n\nShould I go for a more realistic and simulation-like approach? Or should I focus into a more fast-paced and arcade-like game style?\n\nI think both of the styles have their own cons and pros. I subjectively would summarise arcade style as fun, fast and surreal, whereas, simulation is challenging, slow-paced and realistic. Besides that, I fully agree with below definition as well.\n\n*\u201cBoth can be challenging and fun, but arcade games tend to have an easier learning curve. It can be challenging, but allows either a casual gamer or a novice to jump in and be quick while a true simulation requires practice and has a steeper learning curve. A true sim is going be a game that you can\u2019t just jump in and go fast and win. An arcade game is a bit of a level playing field.\u201d*\n\nWe can name and focus on several different aspects of a game like the motion, the effects, interactions or the damage system. To have a more concrete and relevant example, we can examine the turning behaviour of a ship.\n\nIn an **arcade style game** mode, when the input for turning is there, the ship reacts to it immediately and begins its turning. Furthermore, the maximum turning rate is achieved immediately. So, when the right button is pressed, the ship begins turning right, let\u2019s say, with 2 degrees/second immediately. And when released, the turn rate is reset immediately to zero, thus finishing the turning maneuver. We can take the responsiveness of AC4: Black Flag as an example here.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, with a **simulation approach**, when the input for turning is there, the ship begins to turn slowly first. After that, the ship is gaining its maximum turn rate, while rotating faster over time. And when released, the ship continues to turn a little bit more with the effect of inertia until the drag stops the turn of the ship completely. Depending on your viewpoint you can define this motion as realistic or sluggish. The game Naval Action might be an example for that kind of motion. You can check the attached video for the visual implementation of this comparison in my prototype.\n\nWorking with all those definitions, I think going too bold for arcade or simulation style might be too much discriminating a player choice, thus losing the players favoring one of each styles. Of course, I like it, if I can get quick responsiveness of my inputs in a game, but I also like the realism of a simulation like game, where you should think and plan ahead your moves and actions like a chess game.\n\nInitially, my plan was actually somewhere in between. But, determining that sweet spot between arcade and simulation is the nontrivial part of this dilemma for me. To summarise, my questions regarding this topic are:\n\n* It is a fact that the fun and appeal of game-play depends on many things like core mechanics, graphics, SFX etc. I also know that it is mostly a subjective opinion, but in general, how can a game developer decide how much realism and how much arcade style are needed to ensure a fun and appealing game play for most players?\n* I for myself would categorise the game Naval Action as simulation-like, the AC: Black Flag as arcade and Pirates of the Burning Sea in between them. Black Flag is not an MMO like others and game mechanics differ a lot, but has the most sales among all of them. If we exclude Ubisoft and its huge marketing, does this mean that arcade style games are more favorable among the player base compared to more realistic and slow-paced games?\n\nAll of your subjective or objective feedback and comments would be much appreciated.\n\nFair winds!\n\n[Arcade vs Simulation](https://reddit.com/link/mpzk18/video/vj8fb1055xs61/player)",

        "43": "Hello!\n\nMy name is SolarLune, and I'm an independent game developer, and like many of you, I am someone who has struggled heavily with the process of planning games. I've started probably 1000's of games over the past few decades, and finished 3 or 4. It's insanely hard to make games, and I feel like the hardest part is rarely the engine you use, but rather the planning process, and the follow-through.\n\nOver the past year and a half or so, I've been working on a tool *specifically designed* for helping developers to both *plan* and *stay on track* when it comes to developing games. It's also useful for individuals who simply need to maintain their motivation. It's called **MasterPlan**, and I've been steadily improving it with my community over time.\n\nHere's some images (linked, as I can't post images):\n\n[MasterPlan.](https://imgur.com/1BAgv6M)\n\n[MasterPlan with a different theme, shadow, and no outlines.](https://imgur.com/C9nAN6q)\n\n[The Map Task, which can handle creating maps for things like interiors, world maps, etc.](https://imgur.com/s4cGccz)\n\n[And here's the rest of the album so you can get a feel for it.](https://imgur.com/a/6KgOKrT)\n\nThe main reasons why one might prefer to use it is because:\n\n* It has features **specifically designed for indie devs**, like tasks / todo lists, images, gifs, sounds, a whiteboard for simple visual mockups, maps for designing interior shapes / layouts, and tables for completion of repetitive tasks (completing X animations for Y characters, for example).\n* It is **offline**, so you don't need to keep a web browser open, you don't need an account to use it, and your data is stored entirely on your machine, making it trivial to back it up and sync it to version control.\n* It is **simple**, made specifically for small teams or individuals. There's no extra stuff that most individuals don't need, like assigning tasks to people or people to roles, no overarching hierarchies or user creation, etc. It's just made for you and your plan.\n* It is **customize-able**. You don't have to have all of your plan in a single layout like some planning solutions - you can freely place items you want around your board in an effectively infinite space. This makes use of space to avoid pushing everything together in one mental space, and helps to make your plan work for **your** mind specifically. There are also a variety of settings to tweak how the plan is actually visualized (including support for theming), allowing you to make it look the way you want.\n* It also includes things to help you stay **motivated**, like deadlines and timers (which I personally find *extremely* helpful when it comes to keeping my motivation up).\n\nMasterPlan is currently available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. It's available to build for free over on my [Github repository](https://github.com/SolarLune/masterplan) (though prebuilt binaries are available over on Steam and itch, and it's on sale this week as well). If you do purchase it, it would help fund development; otherwise, please do feel free to build it, try it out, and see if it fits your needs.\n\nAnyway, that's it; I appreciate it if you read this far, and I'll get out of your hair now.",
        "44": "Hey folks!\n\nYou may have seen me make threads such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/l165o1/lets_have_a_chat_about_the_dunningkruger_effect/), or [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/l4jlav/the_small_game_a_compilation/). Well today we are going to talk briefly about \"codeless games\". This isn't to bash the subject but to dispell some illusions about making games.\n\nThe general idea is sold as \"you don't need to know how to code to make games!\" which, if you are just on your own at least, is completely false. But what is it that people tend to try and sell you with this claim? The answer is usually Node Based Editors!\n\nIf you've never used a node based editor, the premise is rather simple; You are presented with a bunch of \"nodes\" that each represent some sort of block of code, which gets executed the same way every time it's used. Then you tie that node to other nodes in a daisy-chain like setup. The result is that you have a bunch of nodes that, when executed, will carry out some sort of game-related functionality. Some examples could be Blueprint from Unreal Engine 4, PlayCanvas in Unity or Bolt also in Unity (just to name a few. I think Game Maker also has some sort of node setup?).\n\nNow you might already see the problem here with the \"codeless game\". **Node based editors are code.** Quite a few engines that make use of them actually transpile the node chains you make into written code (like C++), then compile that instead. There are several ways to handle node based editors and they come in many forms. There are also other types of editors that are similar in nature, but doesn't use nodes to accomplish it. Same idea though.\n\nAs a side-note; If you've ever used a material or texture editor chances are you've used a node based editor to do it as those are quite popular in that space.\n\nWhy is this idea being pushed in the first place though? Because programming seems like this intimidating behemoth of a mountain that you have to climb before you can make games. Who wants that? You should just get to making your game already! No need to bother with all that technical stuff right? Well...not quite. Great things take time to make. Programming is a skill that a lot of people are more than capable of learning. But a lot of people are bad at teaching it online.\n\nClearly node based editors are a much more approachable way to look at code when you start out, or perhaps just if you don't want to learn how to write code. Perhaps a nicer introduction to it than writing the code with text. Node based editors are, to put it simply; An abstraction layer. They abstract away the difficulty of learning how to write code from scratch and streamlines the process so you can still makes games, without knowing how to write a piece of software. There are trade-offs of course.\n\nNode based editors tend to get quite unruly once you start making complex mechanics and game setups for example and there can also be quite the performance drain (on a per implementation basis). There are also certain systems and whatnot that are just not well-suited for node based editors. A lot of backend systems in a game (like save-file systems for example) would be much better off being written in code, rather than trying to make that work through nodes. Again, implementations differ of course, but it's just my own general experience talking there.\n\nThis is all to say that, node based editors are valid if you can make a game out of it. Why wouldn't they be? People who were schooled in making software, such as myself, might not really make much use of them because we prefer to write the code. But they serve a purpose for people who might need the programmatic freedom, but don't want to spend years studying for a bachelor's degree in the subject.\n\nWhat's important to take away from this post is that; Whenever someone tries to sell you the idea that you can make a game without code? Know that it is a completely false statement. Someone on your team *has* to know something about programming or how to code in order to make a game.\n\nThis idea that you can somehow make games without programming is one that needs to go away and instead we need to be honest about it. There is no such thing as a codeless game.\n\nBut making games now is more accessible than ever before because of tools like these.",

        "55": "I have a self-made 2D game engine with a renderer that works well. I'm looking for advice on how to support up to 16 textures on the tiled world. I say up to 16 because this is what I learned (?) is Open GL's limit per shader. It sounds like it wouldn't be entirely unreasonable to simply stuff 16 samplers into a fragment shader and then just blend them all. The uniform list on the C++ side will look a bit ridiculous, but hey. Are there other, simpler methods I'm not thinking of?\n\nHere's a picture for reference, straight from the level editor:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/OVQgVNE](https://imgur.com/a/OVQgVNE)\n\nI was staring at the Starcraft 2 map editor the other day, trying to figure out how it might work. It looks like it uses auto tile, with several layers to allow for blending. But it doesn't seem to use layers at all, really. It seems to be layers sorted per-vertex depending on what texture you applied last.\n\nBack to my engine.\n\nThe map is represented by a grid of nodes. Each node has a tile type that represents one of the current three layers: \"void\", \"base\" and \"detail\". In the picture above, the water is \"void\", the dark mud is \"detail\" and the sandy yellow stuff is \"base\". (When picking a \"center\" tile, the tile atlas will sometimes serve up a random non-standard center tile, hence the grassy detail on the sand and some sand on the mud.)\n\nThe mesh generator is passed this grid and uses auto tile to determine what tile to draw for each node, resulting in a set of 3 UV coords for each grid node, one for each texture layer. If a particular node is a \"base\" node, it's base UV will be set and the other 2 UVs will be N/A'ed. \n\nThis is all fine and dandy but this level editor didn't exist 2 weeks ago and it's made me think 3 textures isn't enough. Before this, there was just a random level generator. I'm okay with 3 for the random gen because more textures complicates the algorithm. That leaves me with the problem of how to implement up to 16 textures. I can't figure out how Starcraft 2 does it. I think they may be using a subtile autotile renderer, but they still need to use multiple textures (hence the limit when selecting textures for the floor). That said, you can safely assume I really don't want to write a subtile autotile renderer. I have a tool that generates all the needed texture data from the standard set of 9+2.\n\nThe simple way to support more \"brushes\" for the level editor, like Starcraft 2, is just crank up the samplers in the fragment shader to 16, let the tile atlas editor specify which textures are \"base\", \"detail\" and \"void\" (for purposes of finding out what tile each node should be) and let the user sort it out when making a map as the mesh generator is run on the grid.\n\nHere's my fragment shader, there's not much to it:\n\n    #version 430 core\n    \n    layout(location = 6) in vec4 fragColor;\n    layout(location = 7) in vec2 fragUV1;\n    layout(location = 8) in vec2 fragUV2;\n    layout(location = 9) in vec2 fragUV3;\n    \n    layout(location = 1) uniform vec4 offset;\n    layout(location = 2) uniform sampler2D texLayer1;\n    layout(location = 3) uniform sampler2D texLayer2;\n    layout(location = 4) uniform sampler2D texLayer3;\n    \n    out vec4 diffuse;\n    \n    void main()\n    {\n        vec4 c1 = (fragUV1 == vec2(0.0) ? vec4(0.0) : texture(texLayer1, fragUV1));\n        vec4 c2 = (fragUV2 == vec2(0.0) ? vec4(0.0) : texture(texLayer2, fragUV2));\n        vec4 c3 = (fragUV3 == vec2(0.0) ? vec4(0.0) : texture(texLayer3, fragUV3));\n    \n        diffuse = (c3.a != 0 ? c3 : (c1.a != 0 ? c1 : c2)) * fragColor;\n    }\n\nIt *sounds* ridiculous to simply be adding 13 more samplers to this.

        "57": "First think you need to consider is where your game can be seen. Here I will be talking about released games.\n\nSteam algorithm may surface your game mostly in these places:- Home Page More Like This (Because You Played)- Home Page Recommended For you- Home Page Recommendation Feed- Discovery Queue (if your game is old you will have hard time here)- More Like This on other game pages- Search Results- Tag Pages- A few other places\n\nIn most of these places Steam calculates how well your game fits there. This calculation is based on two parts:\n\n**1. The power of your game:**\n\n\\- How well it sells (it means how much $ it earns per thumbnail/capsule impression)- What is the median playtime (it's a bit more complicated than that, but it's based on the median play time)\n\nThe power is calculated per country. In search results the higher your power, the higher your game is. In other places power of your game is only part of the equation.\n\nTo increase the power, you should:- Create a good looking, fun game that will have good reviews and will look really great on screens. Also that will resonate with the Steam audience. So please do a research before you start making your game and check if there is any audience on Steam for your game. For example: If you create an NES-like retro platformer (like I currently do), remember that people who will play your game are most likely 30+, most younger gamers do not care about NES that much or at all. So if you will make your game around candies and little girls no one will play it. You should use some dark theme for your game, maybe a horror. I am doing this with my upcoming game Vampire vs Devil, you can check it on Steam, I published the page 2 days ago.- Find the optimal price (every game has it's optimal price that will increase your revenue per impression, you need to find it)- Find the best image assets (capsule, screens, trailers)- Find the best description- Localize the page of your game and the game itself. To at least a few\n\nTo find which price/image/trailer/description is the best, you need to use A/B testing. On Steam it's only possible to do the sequential A/B testing. So you keep one version for a week, then another version for another week and then you compare the CTR and Sales/Wishlist per impression stats. Be careful when you analyze the data using the info provided by Steam. Remember to not count the bots traffic and other kinds of traffic that is not related (for example if you are testing the capsule, do not count visits from external websites as they do not see your capsule). So it's a bit tricky on Steam to do this, but it's possible to some degree if you are careful.\n\nIf you want your game to have better reviews and you are still developing your game, read the negative and positive reviews (but especially negative ones) of games similar to yours and do not make the same mistakes.\n\n**2. Tags**\n\nIn most places I mentioned on top of this post, Steam not only use the power of your game but it also checks how well the tags fit to the place and the player. In recent times the power of your game is much more important than it was in the past, so the tags may not help you too much if your game has low power.\n\nThere are at least two tagging strategies you can use, depending on the place you want your game to be.\n\na) If you want to aim for the recommendation places (Recommended for you on top etc.), you should use tags that describe your game very well and that are used by as few games as possible.\n\n**In general the best tag is the one that:**\\- Describes your game as good as possible and is as concrete as possible- It's used by as few games as possible- The games that use the tag are popular and have many potential players that will be related to the tag. If the tag would be used by 1 very popular game, then it means that you have almost no competition but a lot of potential players related to this tag.\n\nb) The other possible strategy to use it to aim for the Home Page More Like This (Because You Played). If your game is somehow similar to other quite popular game, you can use the same tags as the other game and in exactly the same order.\n\nBut very important! Use only tags that describe your game to at least some degree. If the other game has tags that describes feature you don't have in your game, do not use that tag as this will be very badly seen by players and by the Steam itself.\n\nThe other important thing is that for this to work, the target game needs to first be similar to yours, and second needs to have as many tags as possible. If it will have only 10 or less tags rather than 20, it will be not enough to be shown on the Home Page of steam.\n\nRemember that half of the equation here is still the power of your game. Tags are only the second part of it. So even if you would have exactly the same 20 tags in exactly the same order, you may still not appear there in some countries, because your game is not good enough. But most likely you will appear if there are not many other good games similar to yours and to the targeted games.\n\nI would suggest to try both strategies in many possible configurations and see the results. But most of all you should focus on the power of your game as this is the most important factor on Steam.\n\n**What else can you do?**\n\n\\- Add good keywords in the Dev Panel. You may use google keyword planner to find them.- Remember that Steam also uses the Description field as the source of keywords. The description can be long, so having a good description full of good keywords may increase your visibility.- Answer to reviews.- Twitter - post there and use good hashtags. You can see how I approch Twitter, find: @ [Unusualsoft](https://twitter.com/Unusualsoft). Twitter is also very good to get feedback and to see if someone will like your game at all. Very valuable!- Open your wishlist page as soon as possible.\n\nIf you have any other advices, post them in the comments.",

Should I create a seperate shader and render pipeline for processing triangles as the first deals with quads?",
        "63": "**TL;DR:** I am having trouble with all aspects of mesh generation for chunks, I would like a few pointers.\n\nI am developing a game similar to Minecraft and I have some trouble. My current system works, but not well. Basically here is my current system.\n* Worlds are broken down into cubes (chunks) each containing 16^3 blocks (voxels)\n\n* Chunks are stored in a C++ map, indexed by a 64 bit integer (first 26 bits for X, next 26 bits for Z, and last 12 bits for Y), meaning worlds are 2^26 by 2^26 by 2^12 chunks in size.\n\n* Geometry (meshes), which includes vertices, hue, and texture IDs for quads, are generated for any loaded chunks in range, and then are saved in a different map for meshes.\n\n* A mesh consists of a vertex buffer for quad vertices, and texture coordinates, and an 'instance' buffer for quad specific data such as overall hue and texture ID.\n\n* Meshes is generated by a for loop that, for each exposed face for each block in the chunk, 4 vertex data and 1 instance data are appended onto their respective buffers.\n\n* Exposed faces are determined by determining if neighbors are empty (no point generated geometry for faces that are not exposed).\n\n* Blocks at chunk borders require neighboring chunks to be accessed\n\n* This mesh data is (re)generated whenever a new chunk is generated/loaded or when a chunk is changed, and if the changed block is at a chunk border, the neighboring chunk(s) also have geometry recalculated.\n\n* Each frame, the geometry map is iterated, and a draw call is issued for each item.\n\n* Vertex shader is adapted to receive quad vertices rather than triangle vertices.\n\nThis system works for now, but I see several problems.\n* Chunk meshing could be done on the GPU, but I do not see how, because each block has an unpredictable amount of geometry. A buffer the computer shader would write to would have many gaps from blocks with no geometry to render. How should I go about writing a compute shader, where I pass voxel data in, and get geometry out? The size of the output geometry buffer will not be known before hand, and simply allocating the size that will accommodate a chunk with the largest number of exposed faces possible becomes a problem when I introduce complex blocks with complex models. Where should meshing take place? Should complex blocks be meshed separately? Also GPU meshing rules out basically all forms of greedy meshing.\n\n* Mesh for ENTIRE CHUNK must be regenerated even if a single block changes, because the mesh buffer consists of already processed geometry piled up in one buffer, so I cannot know what is what, making it highly impractical to merge new geometry into an existing buffer. Is there a different mesh management system that would permit a practical way to change meshes to reflect block changes without having to regenerate the entire mesh? One that would fit all my other requirements?\n\n* One draw call per chunk is required, bad news if there are a large number of chunks. This happens in a for loop in the draw method (called once per frame).\n\n* Quad vertices will always be whole numbers, so using floats is wasteful, plus, they are always going to be part of a chunks, so theoretically all I need to so is pass the block's location in the chunk and the chunk's location in world to the and let the GPU do all the adding but if you are cutting back that far basically brings you back to the start, voxel data?? AGH!! Plus doing this would eliminate complex blocks from the table so should I make a separate render pipeline and shaders for them too?\n\n* I cannot figure out a practical way to pass variable size arrays per vertex to the GPU, so this rules out passing multiple texture IDs at once for overlaying. How should I deal with textures that are overlain onto other textures?\n\nAll this dealing with chunks, multiple draw calls, meshing, what should be done on the CPU vs GPU, dilemmas, tradeoffs, having to accommodate a bunch of requirements such as support for more complex block models and having to cut back on memory usage, quads vs triangles, all this I have a headache. I have to choose a balance between practicality and accommodating a wider range of features. An easy to see solution would be to have multiple pipelines and shaders optimized for different tasks, such as one for normal blocks, one to handle complex block models, etc, but it ain't so simple. Doing so in of itself is impractical, requiring different buffers for these different block types, leading to more memory usage, more opportunity for error to strike, etc.\n\nCould I please have some guidance for the above concerns?",

        "65": "A year ago today I began work on my first game and now I\u2019m looking down the barrel of my third game with a demo already available. While most people in this forum can probably share similar stories, I had no prior experience or skills in software development of any kind, my background being in marketing, and thus I thought my lessons might be of value to someone who was in my position a year ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Start Small**\n\nA month or so ago there was quite a bit of debate on this forum about how someone should start out in game development. I believe the majority of people came down on the side of starting small and for good reasons but I would like to throw my own voice into the crowd.\n\nPut your *must do* game idea in your back pocket and start on something you\u2019d *like to do* instead, because starting out you\u2019re going to make all of the mistakes. My first game has giant scripts that handle almost everything in scene and features only ONE array. This is the sort of technical debt that saps motivation and kills projects just as they\u2019re getting off the ground. \n\nSomeone with a technical background might not make these mistakes but you\u2019re better off making whatever mistakes you will make with small projects which you can limp to the finish line rather than on your magnum opus.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Finish your projects**\n\nUnfinished projects seem to be a common practice in the Game Development community which I think is a dire mistake.\n\nThe experience learned from finishing a project and the ability to be able to point at something you have made if you want to collaborate in the future is invaluable.\n\nIf you\u2019re knee deep in a project and still have a full bodies worth of work ahead of you think about scaling back, what can you do to get the project out the door in the next month? Not enough time? What about the next two, or three. I\u2019m not advocating for shovel ware but you\u2019ll learn so much about not only the design &amp; publishing process but also how great it feels to **BE** a Game Developer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kill your darlings**\n\nThis is a phrase attributed to Stephen King in the writing community and it gets thrown around a lot, I think it has equal merit in the Game Development community. \n\nIf you have an idea that just isn\u2019t working, no matter how much you love it, you need to kill it. Game development is tricky and time intensive. When you\u2019re starting a new project it\u2019s awesome coming up with ideas and mechanics which you think will play off each other but as soon as you start committing pen to paper some of these ideas just don\u2019t mesh. **Kill them.**\n\nAs a designer you should be obsessed with the core foundation of your game, mentally try to strip back the layers of a game until you have a minimum viable product, anything else is just glazing to this core. \n\nEarly in your Game Development career there may even be ideas that are worth putting in the game that you just aren\u2019t capable of yet. If your game can function without it and you just can\u2019t get your head around how to implement it in a satisfying way then kill it. If your core foundation is solid ground, then any half-implemented idea is only going to hurt the project in the end, you\u2019re better off with 3 great mechanics than 6 iffy mechanics.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Work with what you have**\n\nAs indies we occupy an unsure space in the market. Most marketplaces you\u2019ll be featured next to companies that have a larger lunch budget than your project budget. Trying to compete against these titans on their home turf is going to leave you frustrated. Instead, try to identify a niche you can service. \n\nI\u2019m personally a massive history buff and I have an inclination towards games that ask you to use your imagination more so than feeding the player fancy graphics and cool action. I want players to feel like they\u2019ve stepped back in time and to do that my games have mostly been \u2018event\u2019 based where players are given multiple choice solutions to randomly generated problems in a historical setting where they can play the role of a person in those times.\n\nWork with what you have, if you want to simulate a massive open world then do it, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to show it all. King of Dragon Pass was a major inspiration for me starting out and I\u2019m convinced that with enough skill you can create real, living worlds without a giant studio team.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Build an Audience**\n\nThis advice might not be so relevant for your first couple of games as they may just not be up to snuff but you\u2019ll want to start trying to build up an established fanbase as soon as possible that you can bring with you from title to title. I\u2019d really recommend setting up your social media, Reddit, Discord, Twitter, Facebook, anything you can think of, as soon as possible. Also, link to them on the menu page of your game, it makes it so much easier for players to contact you. \n\nThere are better write ups on here on marketing your game than I can get into in a paragraph but as an indie your best asset is approachability, you can directly communicate with your customers and implement their feedback, this is the sort of relationship a AAA company would go crazy for.\n\nYou should also try to get an intimate knowledge of your given platforms various quirks, for instance on Steam 10 reviews is your sweet spot, the more reviews the better of course, but if you can\u2019t hit your 10 reviews after your first month, you\u2019ll find yourself buried. \n\nSteam also does visibility rounds for major updates to games, which can help push you back into the spotlight. Preparing a fan feedback-based update for a couple of weeks post-launch is a great way to show your fans and potential customers that you care. You should also try and go on sale as often as possible; it doesn\u2019t have to be a huge sale but having that visibility for your wishlisters is awesome. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Just Start**\n\nMy only regret in game development is that I didn\u2019t start sooner. It may be tough to start but hell is it worth it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Thank you for reading**\n\nI hope this is helpful. In the interest of brevity in an already long post I left a couple of points out, I think they speak for themselves though:\n\n**Develop for yourself**\n\n**Collaborate when possible**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR;** I rewrote this a couple of times to try and make sure I was imparting as much pedestrian knowledge as I had to hand. If you\u2019re a grizzled developer, it might not be worth reading but if you\u2019re subscribed to /r/gamedev because you dream of one day making the things you play then stop reading and start doing.",

I'm trying to draw some tetrahedrons where I have the corner vertices.\n\nThe Engine I use (Unity) is based on OpenGL and therefore makes use of either clockwise or counterclockwise winding order for backface culling. I have no idea how I would go about calculating in which order i need to list my vertices (per triangle) so that the tetrahedron is only visible from the outside. I could of course simply double my triangles, but that would come with the downside of doubling my triangles. Can you tell me how to deal with this?

There's an implementation section at the end and I ended up using [this one](https://github.com/Silverwolf90/2d-visibility) in my own game. It works great, but there's one problem: overlapping rectangles.\n\nIt seems as if the original algorithm doesn't support them. On the [little things](https://www.redblobgames.com/making-of/little-things/#bad-input) section the author also mentions that \"the algorithm doesn't handle overlapping lines.\"\n\nIs this possible to fix? For performance reasons, my game has many overlapping rectangles. This allows the line of sight calculation to be much faster since it only has to compute line of sight against 14 rectangles instead of around 200. Allowing for rectangles to overlap greatly lowers the computational cost.\n\nUnfortunately, overlap results in extra triangles appearing. If you scroll down the article to the interactive visualization that lets you place your own blocks, you can see the error for yourself. Put a small box on top of a large box, barely overlapping, like so:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/1Oxhwy0.png\n\nAs you can see (the error is circled in red), there's an extra visibility triangle shown on the opposite side. Interestingly, if you move the small box to the bottom of the large box, there is no error.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/vRWpa1B.png (the error doesn't occur when the small box is under the large box, only when it is on top of it)\n\nSomeone in the comments mentioned that this is possibly occurring due to the sorting, but they don't mention any potential fix.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea on how this could be solved? It is majorly destroying the lighting my game with all these random triangles showing up.",

Spaceslingers was made in GMS and was my first commercial game (but it was by no means my first game, I've been a casual hobbyist on and off for nearly 15 years now).\n\nHere's a small portion of the article:\n\n* Twitter isn\u2019t great for marketing, but it\u2019s ok at gauging interest in stuff. Reddit is pretty good for marketing, but there are some strict rules you need to follow about self-promotion which can hinder your advertising efforts. Don\u2019t do facebook, it\u2019s kinda useless.\n* In the same vein, twitter actively suppresses tweets with links to external websites, so don\u2019t use it to sell your game. Treat twitter like a gamedev conference, to find industry people who might be able to amplify your voice, not general games. A subreddit, a discord channel, or a mailing list (or better yet all three) is where you want to be trying to drive interested people.\n* Make a short, snappy, sweet game that you can pump out quickly for your first release. Don\u2019t make a bad game,  but make a good game that isn\u2019t super-complex to make. Make it quick and price it accordingly, use it to learn how to navigate the steam ecosystem.\n* Marketing starts from before you even decide what project you should seriously commit to. Prototype heavily and post stuff on twitter to see what the interactions are like. Now is the time to use your fellow gamedevs for feedback on ideas. Once you find a  prototype that seems to shine to other people, do some market research on the genre/hook. Use that to decide if it\u2019s worth pursuing or not.\n\nRead the rest here: [Recounting A Successful Failure (The Spaceslingers Post-Mortem)](https://refreshertowel.games/2021/04/13/recounting-a-successful-failure-the-spaceslingers-post-mortem/)\n\nIf you like how I write you can follow me on twitter: [@refreshertowel](https://twitter.com/RefresherTowel)",

I'm designing the universe for Planetary Drift that you can explore after finishing the main campaign. Planetary Drift is a top-down racing adventure game set in space at the heat death of the universe. I don't want to procedurally generate much, and your goal is to get as much of the world's currency as possible. The focus is the racing, so I think I'll build it like this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlayers can generate new race tracks, which are then added to everyone's shared game world as a new star. New stars are added to the universe at increasing distances from the center of the star system, and elements are generated around them. There's a data link station, which lets you view leaderboards and the locations of new stars, a ship hangar, where you can repair your ship and download new engine specs (there are currently 77 different downloadable stat sets with unique names), a planet under attack by a the game's enemy drones, and a wormhole that spits you out one-way at the coordinate opposite your current one.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think I'll implement trade, where you can buy things at the planets under attack and deliver them to other planets under attack, and they'll deal in 4 different goods with prices depending on their quadrant (+,+ / +,- / -,- / -,+ on a 2d grid). Of course, you have to get through the enemies to sell and buy from a planet, which involves an asteroids-like combat system.\n\n \n\nThe main focus will be the racing, which gets you the most light. I'm looking for whether or not there's anything else you'd like implemented on the galactic scale? This will be an infinite space, mind you.",

        "96": "Hi All\n\nI recently got admitted to a game design program I applied to, while I was applying I genuinely thought getting a game design degree is not a bad idea, and to be honest I did not think that I can actually get admitted, I just took a shot. But in after spending time reading all the negative reviews on the value of game design degrees, I became very hesitant, so now even if I got in, I'm not really excited. I think my questions about game design degrees can be summarized to 3 main points, and I hope someone can please help me out with some of these.\n\n1. How bad is the job market for game design majors?\n\nI am not a US citizen but I'm looking to get a job in the US with my degree, and since this game design program is classified as a STEM program (which give me extra lottery opportunities to get a visa), I thought it could help me getting a job here, but since many posts that I reviewed claim that many Americans can't even get a job with their game design degrees, I can only assume worse for the internationals. How bad is the market and will getting a game design master's actually help me jobwise?\n\n\n2. Do companies specifically hire people with game design degrees to write stories?\n\nI stated at the beginning that I initially did not think that I can get admitted, mostly because I have absolutely ZERO experience in programming and only took one very basic game design course during my undergrad career. I actually want to develop story arcs and write scripts for game instead of focus on programming, and I thought about getting a MFA in creative writing or screenwriting, but IMO, a international student getting a writing degree(or any other non-STEM degree) in the US basically means that he/she will have very slim chance of getting a job here, so I applied for this STEM game design program instead. So does American employers actually hire game design graduates to write stories specifically?\n\n\n3. How do I become a game designer/writer with a irrelevant degree?\n\nIf I decided not to get a game design master's, and instead getting a masters degree in irrelevant fields, what are the chances that I can still get hired by employers in the game industry? I realized that portfolios and networking are important, but how can I develop my portfolios and networking while studying and working with people in a completely different field like sociology?\n\n\nThank you guys so much for reading these, as you can probably see it in the post, though graduating from college soon, I'm still confused with my future career paths, which ultimately led to these many questions, please bear with my ramblings and I really appreciate your help!",

Money isn't an issue because my employer pays for it.\n\nI will probably also use that laptop for private gamedev projects and I was thinking about going for a Mac since most of our developers are on Mac OS at work and I like the OS and I'm too much of a \"I just want it to work\" guy to deal with Linux on my work laptop. I had some trouble with Linux on my thinkpad and just installed Windows after 2 days of tinkering with it.\n\nBut I don't like Windows. I'm past the stage where I pick favorites. I just don't see the point in beating my Windows installation into a Unix-ish system using WSL2 and Docker. Like, ignoring the tools I've installed, my personal directories look like I'm using this machine as a social media / shopping device. All my stuff lives in the WSL Linux directories but even then I still have some problems with the system.\n\nAnyway, I used to do some gamedev on my Linux machine and even though it's not as nice as on Windows, it works. Now I was wondering how the experience compared to Mac OS.\n\nOpenGL is deprecated but the current drivers are implemented on top of Metal. Does anybody know if there's a chance for this to just go away? I like OpenGL and I'm not sure if I'll ever get used to Vulkan enough for OpenGL to become irrelevant for me. I couldn't find anything regarding this except that same studios are mad that Apple is deprecating OpenGL and apparently some studios stopped supporting Mac OS because of that.\n\nTalking about Vulkan: The Vulkan subreddit was divided when I asked about this a while ago. How is MoltenVK? Does it work well enough to be used? How has your experience been on a Mac? As far as I know it's just Vulkan implemented on Metal.\n\nAnd how is Metal? Do you like working with that API? With a Mac I could of course also do something for iOS The license is expensive but not too expensive. I'm not doing very graphics intensive stuff anyway so why not target iOS too. \n\nAnd last but not least, how has your experience been with engines? I'm mostly interested in Godot and maybe Unity. They look like the best fit for me but I have used neither.\n\nI do like working without an engine though. I'm probably more interested in the technical challenge of writing engines than writing games.\n\nAnd of course please feel free to share your experience regarding anything else. Tools availability, optimization of the Engine editors, whatever. \n\nEven if I get a Mac for work, I might still get a private notebook and then I'm free to choose.\n\nThanks for you time.",

They say how they differ from other people transmitting in this manner:  They are connecting wireless power transmitters. So think of not just one transmitter that can only send power in one room (10ft),...but a paradigm shift to tens, thousands, or millions of those same transmitters (only much smaller)...meshed networked together to create a seamless ultra-wide area network = limitless distance.\n\nThey say they have the patent for the above process. \n\nAre they saying they basically plan on making something that transmits millions of small beams of power throughout a room then it connects to your phone through millions of small recievers?

        "198": "This is a bit of a backstory, but when I was in highschool I had a waterbed.  The edges of the bed had a frame and the top of that was very cushy.  I tried sleeping many ways, but the most comfortable was to lay between the frame wall and the rounded edge of the waterbed cushion like a pocket. So when I slept, I did not sleep on my back or either of my shoulders.  I slipped myself in between the warm plastic water bag rounded edge and the paneling.  Then I put my right arm and right leg on the frame.  Immediately within weeks, I remarked, \"Mom, I need 2 hours of sleep less, and I feel way more refreshed from this bed, and I don't know why.\"\n\nMath of Sleep:\nAfter I moved out, I was not as comfortable sleeping, but college was tough so it was just one of the many challenges of that time, so I took it like a trooper.  After I graduated for self declared Scientific Computing from Carnegie Mellon with a minor in physics, I got to thinking back to my water bed.  I did the math.  When my arm and leg are supported by a frame, that weight is no longer pushing down on my body.  When my body is suspended by the rounded edge of the water bag and side paneling of the frame, not all of my pressure was laid on a single point.  I would reason that the weight I had pressing down was less than 1/3 of a normal bed.  I concluded, \"That is why I had such a good sleep,  I had a more even distribution of weight.\"  \n\n----\nSounds good on paper, now what? Not many people like waterbeds these days.  Well I got to thinking that it is just two core components, a railing around the edge of the bed with a cushy top, and a \"sleep chamber\" pocket so your weight goes down around the edges and such instead of smaller areas of your back and shoulders in a conventional bed.\n\nEngineering the railing was very very easy. I cleaned off a long 2x4, put it at the proper height of my bed.  The first night I was ill and could not put pressure on my one side.  The next night I was able to try it though, and lo and behold, when I woke up, I didn't have pain in my shoulder or back like I had for the past few months(I put some weight on during covid).   Not only that, I also felt more refreshed and needed less sleep.  \n\n\nThe full arm is about 5.7% of a human male's mass.\nThe full leg is about 16.7% of a human male's mass.\n\nArm+Leg = 22.4% of a human male's mass.\n\n\n\nOf course not all weight gets suspended some fall on torso still, so say 17% of your weight is no longer pushing down on your shoulder.  As a 220lb male, that is 37lb off my shoulder, and it gives a better sleep.   17% * 220 = 37lb off my body.\n\nIt is important not to raise the bar up too high, otherwise, you'll not only be supporting your arm and leg, but also the rest of your body as you \"hang\" from it.   This just winds up stressing your shoulder too hard and counteracts the benefit of a Soft Bed Frame.  So position it properly so it is high enough up, yet not so high that you stress your shoulder and hips.  I find the height I use is around 4-6\".\n\nConclusion:\nSo we know that if you're the type to sleep on your side, try making a cushy bed frame so you can lay your one arm and leg up on it.  It is very easy if you have wood and soft things laying around and takes less than an hour which you regain that very night needing less sleep due to less stress on the downward weight on your body.\n\nNext up is the Sleep Chamber.  I'm sandbagging designing this because it will be more work and I'm not exactly sure what design I'm using.  I bought a small tarp at a hardware store to prototype, and will lay a blanket in it, but the variables are tough to think about without long trial and error.   \n\nSleep Chamber Variables: Does it attach right to the edge of the mattress? Does it attach to the top, middle, or bottom?  What shape is an optimal U?  I'm also not a skilled craftsman so assembling it will end up ugly, and I'm not sure what materials to use to the right side to connect the tarp's others side of the U.\n\n\nI envision a functional mass produced product would be adjustable height in two segments for legs/arms.  I reason you could push the frame outward and set in place by pins for example, and this would open up the optional sleep chamber pocket.   It could be really easy to manufacture and sell.  If everyone needed 2 hours less sleep as I did, 2 hours * minimum wage job of 10$ an  hour * 365 days = 7000$/yr earned.   Paying 300-700$ for a King/Queen/Twin Soft Bed Frame and Sleep Chamber would be a steal.  It isn't just less time needed to sleep, it is also more refreshing and you feel less wake up pains from pressure of weight if you're a big guy.\n\nI figured I'd share that with you guys.  I have found tremendous success making a prototype for myself with just the Soft Bed Frame already.  I know the Sleep Chamber will help, but I'm in no rush to make it.  Have a great day, and maybe in the future, we'll all be sleeping with 66% less downward pressure on our back or shoulders.",

I have never, ever seen this behavior before, to a zillion desktops that I 've tried in the past!\n\nPlease, I wanna know: is there a logical reason for this configuration? Furthermore, is there a setting that can make my keyboard acting \"universally\" to the different shortcut combinations?",

I include those because some of those programs changed how I did things on Ubuntu.\n\nI'll mark where it's command line, and gui so those who want a gui can find tools easiest.\n\nNot everything in this list is Open Source, but overwhelmingly it is.\n\nI'll include alternatives where they exist, mostly for the reason that though I prefer a tool, everyone may not have my same preferences. There are in no particular order.\n\n---------------------------------------------\nLinux Programs:\n\n1. [Glances](https://nicolargo.github.io/glances/): **Command line only.** Glances is a system monitor that runs in the terminal, it gives a very impressive amount of information about a running system, and is an auto-install whenever I create a new server VM, or build a new system. I inevitably look at it once a session if I'm installing anything to see the impact it has on a system life. I can't talk enough good about it. You can install it straight from the repos, or via Pip if you want it at the latest version.\n2. [bpytop](https://github.com/aristocratos/bpytop):  **Command line only.**Another system monitor that is very graphical and pretty and somewhat heavy for a system monitor. Without fail I'll get people stopping at my desk to look at it.\n3. [Zerotier](https://www.zerotier.com/): **Command line only.** Kind of like a VPN but instead only uses middle servers for communication if necessary, so it'll connect directly to the other machine if possible. It creates a virtual network interface like a VPN, and safely sends data encrypted. It can ignore network topography and punch through to machines passed firewalls. This is done safely through access control through a web interface that Zerotier provides, though you can self host it. The result is a very fast and efficient direct connection with any machine over the internet, that you add to that particular zerotier network. It has many competitors, but I've always love it the most. (Some similar competitors: [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/), [Tinc](https://www.tinc-vpn.org/), [Nebula](https://github.com/slackhq/nebula), and two wireguard based ones: [innernet](https://github.com/tonarino/innernet) and [netmaker](https://github.com/gravitl/netmaker). I frequently use this to game with friends. This software is cross platform and works fine in Mac and Windows.\n4. [Tartube](https://github.com/axcore/tartube): It's a youtube-dl GUI frontend, but it's probably the fanciest one I've used. It takes a second to load on even a fast machine, but it self-organizes, and even offers a classic youtube-dlg interface. I'm consistently impressed by it and use it frequently. If you are fine with the command line youtube-dl though, this won't change much for you. If you have differences with the Youtube-dl project, it even works on different forks of it.\n5. [Wormhole](https://github.com/magic-wormhole/magic-wormhole): **Command line only.** A wonderful command line file sharing program that allows you to safely share a file between two computers on the same network, without configuring a file share between them. I use this to send small installers and other config files between my home servers. Wonderful for sending a few files or a directory to a visitor on my network.\n6. [Ferdi](https://getferdi.com/): Ferdi is one of a legion of Electron based clones of software that aims to put all of your communications together into one program so you can manage them. I live on this at work, though I use it at home too. It is heavy, and honestly people can just do this in a different browser, or set of tabs. But this is convenient for keeping communications in a different headspace. It has quite a few competitors, [Rambox](https://github.com/ramboxapp/community-edition), [Franz](https://meetfranz.com/) which is like Ferdi but objectively worse. [Wavebox](https://wavebox.io/) which does something similar to Franz, but works great if you are just one guy. Really though, Ferdi is the best one of these I've found.\n7. [Ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger): **Command line only.** A command line file manager with VIM style keybinds. I use this a lot, and it's available in the Ubuntu Repositories. This is an auto install on all of my servers, for ssh. Available in the Repos.\n8. [Mosh](https://mosh.org/): **Command line only.** I do some work on a reservation not far from where I work as a side job, and connectivity out there on even wires in the ground can be aweful. When I need to remote back to my computers, or send files. cp doesn't fly because it'll get interrupted, and R-sync has a limit to its tolerances. Mosh fixes that, It's SSH but for connections with very spotty, iffy, or little reliability. It works great. Available in the Repos.\n9. [Gnome Boxes](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Boxes): For when I need a virtual environment and I need it now. It's very simple, and being developed heavily. I really enjoy using it, and though it's not my main in-place virtualization solution. (I use [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).) This is great for testing something quickly and then deleting the VM. (I use this a lot on temporary machines that I'm sitting in front of.) This is available in the repos as `gnome-boxes`.\n10. [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/): **Command line only.** A command line tool that converts between dozens of document formats. An absolute must for me at my place of work, and even finds its way home from time to time.\n11. [dcfldd](http://dcfldd.sourceforge.net/): **Command line only.**  The dd command that supports multiple targets. I use this frequently at work to create installation media for both Windows and Linux. Typically this is just me taking an image of a Ventoy Stick and copying it across many of the same flash drive.\n12. [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html):  **Command line only sorta.** This lets you create a boot stick in which all you have to do is dump isos into its secondary partition and you can boot to any of them. This works on pretty much anything that isn't a Mac and has become a way of life for me. I love being able to carry around a USB stick with multiple Virus scanning distros, a full Ubuntu.iso, and a windows installation.WIM if I need to at work. It's growing in popularity with the techs I work with, being able to change what it can boot too without re-flashing it is a huge win for me.\n13. [Zenity](https://help.gnome.org/users/zenity/) &amp; Yad: **Command line only sorta.** For scripters these are amazing tools to create gui dialogue boxes as warnings, input devices, and various other uses when scripting. I use these to make my scripts that I use at work, more friendly to other technicians, so that they don't have to worry about the correct flags when running a script, they just follow the prompts.\n14. [Terminology](https://www.enlightenment.org/about-terminology.md): A Terminal emulator that is heavy, but pretty. This is my preferred terminal Emulator since it will produce a loud ding when I goof a command, and has quite a bit of customization with the right click. It has split views, It has a built in tycat command that will let you view Gifs, and pictures in a directory inline without extra programs. It also lets you open URL's and file directories inline. There is a lot I love here. It's also in the Ubuntu Repos by default.\n15. [Gdebi](https://launchpad.net/gdebi): **Command line only.** Available in the Repos, this is a very simple program to install a .Deb file with. You simply give it `Sudo gdebi something.deb` and its installed. Very easy, and very newb friendly. Gdebi does its best to chase down package dependencies, saving more issues.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nWindows Programs: \n\n1. [Directory Opus](https://www.gpsoft.com.au/): **Not really Available on Linux.** There's only this one Program on Windows that really changed how I see File managers and boy howdy did it. This is paid for software and some expensive software especially on the Windows platform, I pirated it then bought it, because it was so transformative in how I dealt with files. It has amazing renaming capabilities, is a dual pane file browser, can be customized and organized a thousand ways, and makes a lot of very smart decisions in what it does. has a very capable find tool. It is Heavily scriptable and has its own scripting language. I find myself missing it a lot on Ubuntu. **Though it does run in WINE and apparently works quite well, I've not experimented with that yet.** Linux has [Midnight Commander](https://midnight-commander.org/), [Double Commander](https://doublecmd.sourceforge.io/) which I use on Ubuntu in place of Directory Opus. If it was still supported I'd use [Polo](https://github.com/teejee2008/polo) Which can install and work fine even now, but has dependency problems on the Debian based Linux side due to a dependency file being renamed. I've attempted to fix it, but I'm out of my depth in Vala script. I don't have any major issues with file commanders in Linux, Nautilus is great on GNOME. I even use it in conjunction with Double Commander for daily usage, but I still find myself missing Directory Opus.\n\n2. [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/): Open source, but only available on Windows. Flameshot is the closest program in Linux, and honestly replaces ShareX for me entirely. But I still find myself in awe of how many things that ShareX can do with screenshots.\n\n^^^^^Part ^^^^^of ^^^^^me ^^^^^secretly ^^^^^hopes ^^^^^someone ^^^^^here ^^^^^will ^^^^^recommend ^^^^^a ^^^^^Linux ^^^^^File ^^^^^manager ^^^^^that ^^^^^has ^^^^^more ^^^^^of ^^^^^the ^^^^^features ^^^^^of ^^^^^Directory ^^^^^Opus.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nWhole Operating Systems:\n\n1. [Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve): This taught me what a remote hypervisor can and should strive to be. Easy enough to use, and taught me a monstrous amount of what Linux is, and what it can do. Can be installed on all sorts of machines to spin up a few VM's for simple purposes. It provides a great Web interface for creating and managing VM's, their hardware, as well as backups of these VM's to other places, such as different drives in the same machine, another machine entirely. I Personally use SMB(CIFS) to another backup server and have it backup there. It's really great if you want to have multiple services running in many VM's.\n2. [Proxmox Backup Server](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-backup-server): An up and coming star from the same company, Open source in the same way as the first, it's a great backup server, and provides the same excellent web interface that Proxmox does. It integrates with Proxmox VE natively, but can backup a great deal of different kinds of data from other servers too.\n3. [Trisquel](https://trisquel.info/): Basically Ubuntu with no binary blobs, running on the Linux-Libre kernel. If you want to see if you can do literally everything Open source with no Closed source at all, this is the distribution to start with. I personally believe a combo of the two is the most convenient and logical for most people nowadays. But I keep an install of this handy to see how well I can do with just Open Source.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nHope this list provides someone some good reading, and some good ideas in the future. I'm hoping to get more App Recommendations here myself, I figure you never know what App is out there that may change everything about how you use a computer.\n\nTLDR: Apps are neat, have you ever found any that changed how you use a computer?",

He just waited for another update from NVIDIA and the problem got solved. Is this true?",
        "241": "Just wanted to share some thoughts about my latest Linux experience. I would like to begin my post by saying that I deeply admire and support the idea of Linux in the sense of a community-driven, non-commercial operating system that allows us to step back from corporate-owned systems and programs (looking at Microsoft and Apple). My primary interest does not lie in the advanced level of control that Linux gives to the user, or the potential for tinkering and customizing your desktop and user interface.\n\nI installed Ubuntu 20.04 on my laptop along with a fresh installation of Windows 10 (my previous win10 laptop completely crashed due to hardware issues). So, dual booting it is. After some work, I managed to finally set up GRUB properly and everything worked without any problem. It is worth noting, however, that default Ubuntu dual boot installation did not allow me to choose between two OS before I googled some solutions, instead it booted me straight into Ubuntu. So that is something to consider. I used Solus OS on my old laptop earlier, but I was not satisfied with it, because the community is relatively small, so many problems I encountered were not answered at all. Also, the update download times were atrocious. So I opted for Ubuntu, knowing that help and support won't be lacking.\n\nNew Windows installation was as fast as Ubuntu for the first two weeks. After that, it became... considerably more sluggish than Ubuntu, so I suppose that is a point for the Linux camp. One thing I did not like was the Ubuntu software center, it often suffered from freezes and bugs (such as showing programs which I installed the moment before as not installed), and many of recommended applications seemed... odd because they had only a couple of votes and yet were at the top of their category. Installation via terminal was sometimes broken as well. For example, I tried to install OnlyOffice, only for it to break completely and get many mistake messages even when trying to install other applications via terminal. For me, the initial Ubuntu icon pack looks very ugly, so I changed it to dark papyrus, but I recognize that these are matters of taste and cannot be discussed rationally.\n\nI work as a teacher, so MS Office is a must for job-related tasks. Imagine my relief when realizing that Libre Office is fully compatible with MS Office and can save files in docx. format! One thing I did not like was that Times New Roman (which my institution considers as an \"official\" font) was not installed by default, but I can understand the open-source, non-proprietary philosophy behind it. I do not like the Libre Office interface, even when changed to the classical \"ribbon\" interface, it is a field with much to work on if they ever want to come near MS Office.  It would be also nice if Impress came with more preloaded themes for presentations, as I find the ones already listed to be really, really ugly and bland in the worst possible way. I also installed WPS office which suits my needs even better, so points for Linux on that also.\n\nOther programs I use are statistical packages like SPSS, but I found a really good, free alternative in PSPP, which I also started to recommend to my students. Some more complicated things can not be done without additional SPSS packages and AMOS, so I need to keep my Windows installation for some more time, alas. I was thrilled with evince document viewer, it is so useful and nicely minimalistic when reading books and comics! But, it needs to have better highlight text options, so I still use Foxit Reader when reading books for my lections and studies (and the Linux version works very nicely).\n\nMy customization consisted of installing dash-to-dock and ArcMeny, but those two extensions broke for some reason and I had to reinstall them. No problem, everything works fine for now.\n\nSo, to conclude my story, I think that Linux has so much potential to make a better world free from the monopoly of corporations, and also to teach us more about using our computers the right way. It promises so much - which makes its failures even more painful because I can't recommend it to my less tech-savvy friends in clear conscience. It needs to be even more simplified (although Ubuntu made a really good job with that), the role of terminal minimized, in order to truly function as a real alternative to major OS. I do not mean this as a provocation or an insult to this community but as a recommendation for all developers to have a userbase of ordinary people in mind, not just highly computer literate people. I live in a poor Eastern European country where everybody uses a pirated Windows and lives in this gray zone. I think truly embracing Linux in developing markets, intended and designed for ordinary users, is a way to go.",

If you turn a particular connection off..., it just turns itself back on and reconnects if the remote BT device is available.\n\nAnother problem I'm seeing on my Thinkpad is the general inability to turn off BT and have it STAY OFF after a sleep/wake cycle.  Turn BT off.  Suspend the machine.  Wake the machine..., and BT just turns itself back on.\n\nI've posted on Lenovo's Linux forum.  I've posted on Ubuntu's Forum (Networking/Wireless).  I've even filed a bug on launchpad.\n\nSearching most of those places reveals many questions about current BT problems, but very few answers..., the Ubuntu Forum really stands out in this regard.\n\n**Has anybody found a way to get any response/action on current BT problems?**",

The thing is when both left and right mic channels ( i call them channels but i don't know what they really are) are working the mic is muted. So all i have to do is use pavucontrol to mute the left one. Thing is this time there are some auto balancing shenanigans at work that are getting in the way.

Reason is linux mint has some permission obstacles with certain enterprise software and i can find more documentation around ubuntu. Trying to use it to produce work, don't really want to play around with compiling sources.\n\nWhat happens:\nI migrated all the code over from mint on the old xeons to ubuntu 20.04 on the new 3990x. I open intellij, vlc, chrome and start running scripts, after a few hours it stops responding(sleep is turned off). Weird I thought... Maybe it's a graphic card issue so I put in the R9 390, same thing happens. Ok... I will try and install it on the old xeons to see if it happens there. Same thing regardless of which gpu is installed. Ok... Maybe it's a bad usb/ isodownload, I will switch it out, maybe try 20.10, same thing still happens.\n\nI know mint is based on debian same as ubuntu, however I have never had stability problems with mint, however I have stability issues on both machines running ubuntu 20.04.\n\nI'm not looking for bleeding edge features, just a solid desktop that I can install on my main machine and use the same distro across others to deploy kubernetes on(I'm still a beginnerwith k8's and want to stick with a gui for now in case I mess something up).\n\nAny idea why ubuntu would be crashing where as mint, fedora, open side are all stable as can be?\n\n\n*As an odd side note, while distro hopping and trying opensuse on the new machine, I noticed the code scripts I run only use 16gb of ram out of 32gb, however on fedora/ubuntu/mint it uses 26gb.

Early December rolls around and I email the HR person I received the offer from initially, no response. I wait about 3 weeks, by now I have graduated and am expecting to start work soon. I email again, no response. Another 2 weeks goes by, I email again, but CC my former boss from the summer that I was told per the offer letter I would be working for again - no response from either. \n\nAt this point, it is February and I have not heard a word from UPS since I accepted the offer months prior. Keep in mind, I did not apply to a single job once I accepted the position because I assumed I was setup and was satisfied with the role. \n\nAfter being ghosting for many emails, I directly emailed my old boss asking what was up and if he could contact HR for me since I was unable to. He responded and said he would and keep me updated. 3 weeks go by - nothing. I email him again and he responses saying HR said \u201cthe offer was contingent on if there was a position available and it seems like there isn\u2019t any open positions\u201d. There was never a mention of this on the offer letter, which included salary, a signing bonus, and more. The offer listed listed the contingencies very clearly and it simply wasn\u2019t one of them.

Luckily I was able to find a job soon after getting kicked in the balls by UPS so it did not delay my progress too bad, but the way this was handled with the lack of care really shows a lot about this company. \n\nIf you take anything away from this, know that:\n\n1) If you are given an official offer letter, it means nothing. It can be rescinded for no reason with no legitimate explanation. \n2) HR is horribly ran at this company, at least at the corporate office working within F&amp;A. They do not care about you and don\u2019t even have the heart to respond to one email when you have accepted a job. \n3) They seemingly tried to screw over a former intern that was newly entering a spotty job market after graduating college, by pulling an offer because of a contingency that was never mentioned in any capacity.\n\nI\u2019m happy to answer any questions or concerns, and god speed to any of you working at this company.

        "309": "I've been a professional software developer for nearly 15 years and have worked for several companies, large and small. I've been with my current company now for nearly 3 years and it was all going great until a few months ago. We were a team of 4 devs with one splitting time between lead developer and scrum master. We lost 2 senior devs to attrition so I was forced to pick up the slack as the lead dev/scrum master, despite not having any scrum master training. On top of that, the workload wasn't reduced to compensate for the loss of resources.\n\nThe thing I'm hear to complain about is the other developer on the team. He's a junior going on mid-level dev and he just can't cut it whatsoever. He's been here about a year and a half and just lacks the fundamental intellectual curiosity to perform. It has become painfully obvious that he was able to hide behind the accomplishments and work of myself and our other 2 devs. Over the past year I've had to sit him down and painstakingly figure out what he's missing and find gaps in his knowledge. We had a detailed support document full of KPIs that I updated and shared with him on numerous occasions, making sure to sticky it in Slack and verifying that he had a bookmark to it on his bookmarks toolbar.\n\nI'll be going on an extended (and much needed) mental health break in a month where I'll be camping in the woods with no computer and spotty cell phone access. My boss is now concerned about this dev's ability to support our \"mission critical\" application and has put the onus on me to make sure he's up to the task. Like, what the fuck else am I supposed to do? I've sat him down and showed him how to diagnose problems, I've made sure he has appropriate production access, made sure he can open support tickets. This guy is a fucking grown ass, professional man making lots of money. At what point does it become his fucking responsibility?\n\nMy fear is that if something happens while I'm out and they can't reach me, that this dev will just throw up his hands and then it'll be my fault when I get back. There's only so much I can do. I've already recommended that this dev be put on a performance improvement plan, but management is reluctant because there's a lot of paperwork involved. I'm at my wit's end, to be honest. I'm stressed out because I can never trust this dev to provide support when things happen. He goes down rabbit holes chasing red herrings, despite my coaching and showing him in the support doc where to look.\n\nAnother catch is that my company has a stock ownership plan but I don't fully vest until October, so I can't exactly give management an ultimatum. I've already updated my resume and sent out some feelers. I really like this company and after bouncing around for a few years thought I'd landed in a pretty sweet gig. But this management is just god-awful and not willing to do what's necessary to ensure our success.\n\nThank you for allowing me to vent.",

Instead, was picked up by a high level director who I've been working under for the past 2 years.\n  \nProblem I: My manager hasn't given me any opportunity to code and instead has pushed me hard to be a business analyst / product owner / project manager / ish. I've mentioned early on that I want to code but have gotten nowhere. He says he's doing this because he sees my strengths in communication / requirements gathering / being responsible. (I was in sales and owned a small biz before.)\n\nProblem II: I'm not happy filling out spreadsheets / sending emails / holding meetings 10-12+ hours a day on an entry level salary. Plus it's very stressful, and I don't have time for side projects or even family.\n\nProblem III: I'm broke. Since I started working, my wife lost her job, I had two kids (three in all), plus unexpected bills that's put me under. I can't make my monthly bills and have maxed out my CC's; I have two months left before I'll be forced out of my house. Also, I'm tired of being broke and stressed.\n\nQuestion: What do I do? I have two years experience as a SE on paper, but no real coding experience. I have no idea what positions I can / should I apply for. I want to leverage my experience in some way, but I don't know how. \n\nAny ideas?\n\n\nExperience: Early on I took over for a senior reporting resource end-to-end, delivering 400+ client-facing reports for 8 months (it was an emergency that no one else wanted to touch). Currently I'm juggling 30+ different threads (from requirements gathering to chasing data to handling stakeholder communications to...), plus I'm 'the throat to choke' on 3 products + 1 project. These are either client or executive facing, hence the high pressure. (On an entry level salary.)\n\n\nMy dream was to produce a stand-alone software product after gaining on-the-job experience, but now I just want a high paying job so I don't go under. \n\nSorry in advance any errors.\n  \n  \nEDIT: I realize I need a new job, just not sure if I can leverage my experience. Am I stuck studying for /applying to an entry level position?",
        "312": "I've been at my new job for a couple of weeks now. I am actually a long term remote worker and I have been remote for about 7 years now. My last company had a pretty good formula with establishing a remote culture. We had ice breakers, remote happy hours, employee directories, posted memes and shot the shit in slack, had rooms dedicated to specific interests (pets, music, video games etc), a million emojis, and robust onboarding plan. It wasn't perfect by any means, but we tried to do our best to put an actual person behind that name on a screen.\n\nWell that company went broke due to COVID and I just started a new position. I've been there for weeks now and it's \"all business\". It's around 500 people and you might get 5 or 6 messages a day in dozens of chat rooms. There's been no \"get to know each other\" sessions or ice breakers. No company directory other than an org chart. I have people reach out to me and I don't know who they are, where they live, or what they even do outside of their titles. My onboarding has been a disaster and I can't tell if certain people just don't want to talk to me, or if that's just their personality. If my company has values and goals they have never been presented to me. I have never met the department lead and I don't even know what the CEO looks like.\n\nQuite frankly, there is zero remote culture and no attempt to make one. It seems extremely cold and unwelcoming. So my question to you is how does your company handle remote culture? Is this just a normal setup at most companies these days? What should the baseline expectation be?",

        "316": "Hey all, so I had [written here last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mlgam0/new_developer_manager_is_extremely_abrasive/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) about some situations I was facing with my manager. I\u2019d resolved to eventually work up the courage to speak with either him or my boss about it and polish my resume just in case. \n\nToday during our daily standup, my manager asked me to explain my code. I did so, he said he didn\u2019t understand, I re-explained why I did what I did and also pointed out that there were no notes on this specific thing in the outline. Verbatim \u201cThere wasn\u2019t anything in the outline for this specific feature so it made sense to me to (edited to add context) add inputs to update the user\u2019s information since this is the user information page. Could you *please* explain to me what you envisioned instead or what about my explanation doesn\u2019t make sense?\u201d I was not irritated or annoyed, I always keep a positive tone. My manager replies, \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re being so defensive, I\u2019m not attacking you.\u201d I was not being defensive, I was answering a question that he had asked me. So at this point I said \u201cI\u2019m not being defensive, I am trying my best to answer your question. If we can\u2019t understand each other then can we please move on?\u201d He said no, he wants to understand *why* I did this. I\u2019m at a complete loss because I am being 100% clear, so my coworker jumps in and literally explains everything that I just said back to my manager. My manager then says \u201cSee, choctawbae, you didn\u2019t need to be defensive. &amp;amp;lt;coworker&amp;amp;gt; was able to explain it for you.\u201d \n\nAt this point I was pretty frustrated and he continued to ask me questions during the code review and I felt I couldn\u2019t answer them or explain why I did something without sounding defensive. This is on a project that I have \u201c100% creative freedom\u201d on. At the end of the meeting I asked if I could speak with him. I was very respectful and objective and made sure to use \u201cI verbs\u201d. I explained that it was very frustrating and discouraging to be called defensive for answering his questions. I didn\u2019t understand why he has called me defensive multiple times on a meeting, while he and my coworkers can yell over each other the entire time without doing so (didn\u2019t say it like that but yeah). I told him that I felt I was being perfectly clear in my explanations and if I wasn\u2019t, just telling me \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense\u201d isn\u2019t helpful. And that when I ask \u201cCould you please tell me what you envisioned?\u201d I\u2019m not trying to be defensive, I am genuinely asking because I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m a new dev and I\u2019m still learning. I reiterated to him that giving details helps me to learn. \n\nIt felt like he was gaslighting me. He kept saying \u201cI was genuinely just trying to understand what your idea was here, you seem insecure in your ideas and I want to get you to the point where you feel better about them.\u201d But I wasn\u2019t presenting an idea, we were reviewing a specific feature in my code. This \u201cidea\u201d had been in production for months. So \u201cWhy did you do this? This doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d is extremely confusing in a page that already existed that I had creative freedom on. \n\nHe said that my coworker was able to explain perfectly, when he literally just restated what I was saying. He ignored the part where I told him that calling me defensive during a meeting is rude especially when he hasn\u2019t called any of my other colleagues defensive (and they straight up yell at each other??). He kept telling me that my reasoning for what I wrote in the code was because I didn\u2019t know what to do (because I mentioned there were no notes on it in the outline) and seemingly ignored the parts where I very clearly stated how I came to that conclusion. He kept trying to make it seem like I had offered up my explanation out of nowhere and that he never asked me to explain?\n\nI didn\u2019t leave the conversation feeling any better. If anything I feel like I not only can\u2019t ask questions, but I can\u2019t even answer them. I guess the next step is speaking with my Boss (the CEO) but I honestly don\u2019t even know how to bring it up or how to sound while bringing it up. Because anything I do sounds defensive and argumentative. I\u2019m starting to question if maybe I am being difficult. I\u2019ve been recording the meetings as others have suggested and when I listen back to them I don\u2019t feel that I sound defensive or argumentative? But I have also started trying to polish my resume. I appreciate the advice that you all gave me last time and wanted to provide you with an update.",

        "324": "I'm 25. For the past three years I worked in sports analytics. Basically data collection, explaining data, and helping with strategy rollout. Next to no day-to-day experience with Excel, SQL, Python, whatever. My job was very niche and now that I've left that industry because it's been crippled by COVID, I'm just looking for jobs to survive. The job search has been grueling. My industry, while it had transferable skills, left me with next to no technical skills. I realize it was a dumb mistake, but when I started at 21 it was the dream and I pursued it without much background. \n\nAnyway, I started grad school in March 2020 for CompSci. I got my undergrad in 2017 in Business. I like my program and am probably about as good as you'd expect someone to be in 4 semesters. I graduate in Spring 2023 if all goes well. I like it, I find more meaning in it, but I'm by no means a confident programmer. Frankly, I'm leaning towards Data Science, where I'd really only necessarily need to be really good at Python. But, I'm current 6 months unemployed and too inexperienced for a CompSci job, but I hate business. \n\nI'm applying to everything...Marketing, Management, it's all so deflating. But, that's my undergrad, unfortunately. I get some calls about more analyst adjacent positions which excite me, but they never come to fruition. I usually fail around technical assessments. I just need to survive. But I have some PTSD-esque fear in my next move being the wrong one. For instance, one job that's speaking with me is for \"Associate, \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ Marketing.\" The skills asked for are \"Leadership, Client Communication, Excel Fluidity Reporting, Strategy Execution, Portfolio Management.\" That doesn't feel really relevant. So, let's say that's on my resume....what tech company is going to consider me? I guess I get some Excel experience in there, but that's about it. I'm scared of being boxed out at 25 and I don't know how to be better equipped for more technical jobs.\n\nMy school advising has been generally useless. I have a 3.8 GPA, SQL is coming naturally to me. But, I don't know what to do. Currently, I need to survive. So I get that's important, but I'm scared if I get no tangible work experience, nobody in CS will hire me when I get my Master's. What can I do? Are there like any entry level jobs I could find? How do I make myself appealing to employers so I can have a full career in CS? I feel like such shit. Business was a mistake, but I didn't know better. Sports was a mistake, but I didn't know better. I feel boxed in. I want to change and be in this field. But I have no actionable path, nobody to go to, and I absolutely need to be in a place where I can succeed. I know I won't be a Senior Analyst day 1, but something that can help me build skills in a workplace setting where I can maybe earn some money. I don't know.

        "326": "So I'm a new grad but I obtained a job at a startup. I've worked there for about half a year now and I do enjoy my job for the most part. However, I'm starting to notice a pattern in tasks that I'm assigned that has raised a bit of a yellow flag for my career development. When I was hired, the company expressed I would have opportunities to try many things and work on a variety of projects for my career growth. I was hired along side several others but most were new grads as well (undergrad and grad) along with a few senior or higher ranked devs.\n\nAt first we were assigned a variety of tasks from frontend to backend to supporting ml if we wanted to learn from a real world perspective. I picked up a lot of frontend tasks faster, which initially was fine. My co-workers picked up on backend a lot faster. However, now I get assigned exclusively frontend tasks or \"easier\" tasks like code clean up or database cleanup. And when I do want to jump in on backend tasks the projects have developed to a point where I feel like I'd have to be onboarded on to be of any use, which it's become clear no one has time to do based off of the timeline for projects.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love frontend dev. But I ideally would like to mature into a full-stack dev. So I've been pointedly assigning myself to more backend tasks that I think are more foundational and not advanced. Like setting up a project structure or even research tasks. However, my manager will always add a supporting member from the backend team to help me with the task. Initially that was fine, because I get it. I don't do backend tasks often and it would make sense to have someone support who knows the project and routinely does work on it. However, my learning style is do and learn. Learn from doing. My coworker who supports just ends up doing it or I'm in the back seat during pair programming. So I don't actually get a chance to do much of anything and I feel incompetent after when my team is like okay so can you handle that and I say no, I'm still lost. At this point I'd rather follow a tutorial to do it myself than do pair programming again in my life.\n\nContrary to other projects, where most of them didn't have as much support so I had to do it by myself, learn from scratch, or really reach out to a senior dev if it was something that went beyond me.  Those projects I am entrusted to do my tasks on my own and meet deadlines. Those projects I feel the most confident on. But I don't want to be only known as the UI guy, especially because all of my coworkers know how to do UI. If I left, my coworkers could easily do what I'm doing. But if one of my other coworkers left the company would be in a bit behind on projects as they restructure or train. Theres even smaller projects that some of the backend guys do UI for. It's really hard hearing project leads ask for certain devs because they have a wider or more applicable skillset whereas I won't get mentioned much because there's nothing UI related they may need me to do.\n\nI really just want advice on how I should bring this up to management or how I should deal with this going forward in my career.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR.

I should be applying the September of freshman year right?\n\nRight now I'm a senior in hs, so i'll be a freshman next year. I unfortunately was fucking dumb and unable to find an internship for this summer. I did manage to get 2 sorta research roles, but they're not like REUs or anything, they're more informal and idk how they're gonna go. I am going to an ivy btw, but not hyp. Do I even have a decent shot at getting a good tech internship next year?

However, in the past year our org went through several rounds of re-orgs/leadership changes and most of the original team have left the company. What's left is a pretty toxic/political relationship between the new engineers and managers that makes work less enjoyable. \nHere comes my dilemma.\n\nThe team still has a lot of large scope projects coming down the chute and due to my somewhat established domain knowledge on the team (did two internships on the same team prior to coming back fulltime), I'm put on project after project that's hailed as high priority with upper leadership visibility and just can't seem to get back into the recruiting grind(LC, Grokking, cold emailing recruiters, the whole shabang). There are high tide weeks where I am simply too exhausted after work and all I want to do is rest. On low tide weeks (usually just a week before a new thing comes in) I'm doing refactor work/reading design docs. \n\nSo I'm kind of stuck. I did the whole CTCI bible studies and LC marathons in college but I just can't seem to have the mental energy to do those right now.

        "343": "Hello,\n\nI am a freshman who was recently offered an internship at a small company. Basically, I would be introduced to their tech stacks as well as work on a capstone project. I am extremely grateful for this opportunity and understand how difficult it is to get an internship.\n\nHowever, before the offer, I was doing some course planning for my degree and found that if I don't take a summer class this summer, it would be a lot harder and I would have to take multiple technical classes in a semester. In addition, I need to hit a certain GPA requirement to declare computer science as my major, so I ideally do not want to take heavy classes together. My thought process for the summer class would be that I would be able to devote all my energy and time to a single class, in an attempt to get a high grade.\n\nWith this in mind, I am struggling to make a decision. If I take the internship, my resume gets a major boost since this will be my first technical work experience, but I would have to relocate since the internship is onsite (housing is paid for, though). In addition, my course planning gets a bit more complicated, and I might not be able to get a high-enough GPA to get the CS major. So it really comes down to major vs. work experience. However, since most freshman don't have internships anyway, would it be alright to take the summer class instead? Thank you!\n\nEdit - Spelling",

        "348": "Hello everyone!\n\nI want to start off by saying i've been lurking this subreddit for quite a while on my main account and over the months i've read so much good advice, information and help on here. So a BIG thank you to all of you that are a part of this community!\n\nTLDR: As a hardware/infrastructure oriented person i for some reason spent most of my recent years teaching myself programming. \nLearned enough to land my first job as junior software dev and absolutely love the company i'm at now. Been at this place a couple months now.\nNow slowly realizing i made wrong decisions, that i don't really enjoy programming enough to do it full time and that i probably should've stuck with what i have always done and loved (hardware, infrastructure, networking).\nNow trying to look for ways to hopefully change direction to a sys admin/engineering role but as far as i can tell i am just stuck now in a role i don't really enjoy all that much.\n\n\nAnyway, pardon me if there is a lot to read, i want to try to not make this into a huge wall of text but don't want to include too little context either so here goes.\n\nSo basically, like many many others, for as long as i can remember, i have LOVED (and still do) working with computers, more specifically hardware. \nThis passion quickly grew to expand beyond just regular home-use browsing computers and so i figured out i just genuinely enjoy figuring things out and working with computer/server hardware (learning how they work, how they interact with the rest of the system and diving deeper as i went), infrastructure (things like how servers work, how servers and environments are set up,...) and also networking i came to realise later. \n\nAnyway, fast forward until after shitty education.\nI did everything i could to at least get a high school degree and so i did and graduated as a computer technician. \nThis didn't get me any job though (not a big surprise, was a shitty school too).\n\nAt this point i realised that i was going to have to look into sysadmin and system engineering jobs if i wanted to do something that i love. The thing is though that i don't have the degree nor enough knowledge from self studying to realistically get hired.\n\nI had dabbled with and tried a bit of programming before and i quite enjoyed that as well. After a while i realised it wasn't as hard as i initially thought and just started self studying every day to teach myself programming. Started with simple web dev, then eventually taught myself java for the most part with a little bit of other stuff in between.\n\nAfter spending a bit over 2 years for the most part teaching myself to code (took a couple months break in between those 2 years) and a whole lot of interviewing i eventually finally landed my very first job as a junior software engineer at a great company.\n\nI've been working for this company for a couple months now and i genuinly enjoy working there. \nThe problem is that i'm starting to slowly realise more and more that enjoying programming at home doesn't mean you'll enjoy it at work.. \nI knew this was a possiblity but there really isn't a way to find out without trying right?\n\n\nSo i'm now finding myself in a situation where i just got my first job in the field i put all my work and time in to get into and realising i'm not really enjoying it all that much.\nDon't get me wrong i do enjoy working in IT very much but i'm not sure programming is for me, at least not doing it full time.\nI've always been more of a hardware and infrastructure person and how i suddenly ended up here i don't even know.\nI feel honestly so incredibly stupid especially because they were all my own choices but apparently the wrong ones..\n\nWhat do i do in this situation? I'm slowly feeling myself dreading to go to work but going unemployed again is no option. Teaching myself enough about system administration/engineering and being able to prove my knowledge seems to me right now like an impossible task as well.\n\nCouple things i've thought about doing so far:\n1) Looking out for junior system admin/engineering jobs and maybe try and interview for those and see what happens but i'd honestly hate leaving the company i'm at now too.\n2) Asking my current employer if i could somehow make a switch and become a system admin/engineer at this company instead of programmer but being only very recently hired as a junior software dev this feels really stupid to do honestly.\n\nTo be fair, i just feel stuck at this point. Not sure what i can or should do.\n\nI'll gladly take any and all advice and help you guys can offer me. I have nobody else to really talk with about this either so that is also part of why i'm posting this here.\n\nI cannot tell you how much i appreciate every single one of you and thank you soooo much if you decided to read my post.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions if you want to or if something is unclear.",

It rolled over from an internship and I have really have loved my job thus far and am making good money (70k) with solid benefits in Norfolk VA (which is pretty low CoL). We've been remote thus far and at first I wasn't too keen on it cause I was locked in my house and couldn't go anywhere but I ended up moving in with my parents again and building a life in my childhood hometown in NoVA over covid while working remote. I also reconnected with a friend from college and we began seeing each other over covid and I've built a really solid community too here that I wasn't expecting but am so thankful for.\n\nAlthough for the time being I haven't really been looking for a job, a smaller company contacted me for a fully remote position in Data Engineering (what I really want to do) for 90k and an 10% sign on cause they saw my LinkedIn and Hired.com profiles and wanted to chat. The interview is tomorrow but I've already been talking with some of the engineers and they seem really genuine and I like the work there too.\n\nAt first it was just to gain experience in interviewing and stuff. But I've reached the point where I am dreading the day I was gonna be asked to come in to work again in person cause that would make things long distance (3hr drive) with my girlfriend and would move me away from my friends at home. I love my job and my team and we just started a new project so I really would hate to leave them so soon, but the new job is exactly what I wanted (smaller company, less bureaucracy, data engineering, remote, better pay).\n\nOut of a sense of duty, I feel bad just throwing my old team away but I want to leverage this opportunity to ask to be fully remote. I don't necessarily want a pay raise or anything (although it would be nice) but I just can't see myself going back in person anytime soon. I love the freedom to work from wherever and I like being able to be in my hometown with my girlfriend and friends and family and not feel tied down at the same time.

In this job I was able to learn how employee databases work internally, some networking, and other small things here and there. During this time I have also been studying at my University for my B.S. in Cyber Security but only been able to take 1-2 classes every other semester since I can't afford more due to not having financial aid or any scholarships/grants.\n\nIn terms of knowledge, I studied and took a Net+ course but never got to take the exam, so I know some information.

I was recommended an \"Analyst\" job but they seem to require years of experience on the job and some certifications. I don't want to set myself up for failure and want to be careful with job choices since I just recently moved out and have accrued new bills. My former manager recommended a Hospital entry level IT job but I'm not sure if that's necessarily going to teach me anything since it might just be too basic.\n\nI was also recommended to look for an internship but I'm not sure if there are any internships outside of the 8-5 work hours or only on weekends. I have no problem with an internship from 6pm+ or any time on weekends but they are pretty rare.\n\n**Learning**\nI'm trying my best to use my free-time to listen to Professor Messer, podcasts, advise channels of the career, and others while I drive or I'm at home.

I love the org and the team I\u2019m on, but I can tell in a year or two I\u2019ll likely be bored (role isn\u2019t as technical, small scope, process dev instead of web/SWE), so I figured I\u2019d look for other opportunities by then before too much time passes since my last web dev job.  \n\nThe main issue is, I\u2019m planning to get pregnant in the next year.

        "356": "Recently I have gone through a transformation physically (lost 150+ lbs) as well as mentally. About a year ago when the pandemic started, due to a lot of reasons I decided it was a good idea at the time to quit my very stable and secure sysadmin job and focus on finishing my bachelor\u2019s in software development. \n\nAt the time I thought it was a good idea because of the way my workplace was treating covid-19, their employees, and being stigmatized because I was taking it more seriously than everyone else. To explain, my wife is immune-compromised, and is in the demographic that covid-19 was tearing through at the time.\n \nNow I wonder if it was a good idea. The workplace was toxic for many more reasons and shortly after I quit, covid-19 went through the I.T. department and their families. So, I think it was a good decision just for that reason. \n\nHowever, I am now at a point where I finished my degree and built several projects from the college where I was told that these were portfolio projects that would get me hired out of college, especially the capstone.\n \nI graduated in February 2021 and I have been steadily applying (4 \u2013 5 job applications every day) and I got a few nibbles, but because I do not have 3+ years of experience I am quickly disregarded. Around the same time I graduated I was invited to intern at a good friend\u2019s company working on one of the apps that they are building. It is interesting because they are using blazor, so that was cool to learn a bit about. I was given the task to implement form and data validation and then write tests to prove that it works. This was a very good learning experience.\n \nHowever, my friends\u2019 business partner has made it obvious that he does not like my presence and feels like I need to pay rent for the space that I take up.  I ended up buying some drinks and some other things to contribute as well as do some menial tasks when I go in and that seems to have calmed him down for the most part. However, he is still very snide when I come in and makes it clear that he wishes I were not coming in.\n \nI tried to address this with my friend, but that led to \u201cOh yeah, he does that just ignore it man. I get tired of having to translate for him, so just let it go and don\u2019t worry about it\u201d. I was not expecting the red carpet to be rolled out or anything, but I am working for free, buying stuff for the office, and try to accommodate his business partners quirks so that I am not annoying him or anyone else. I do not want to be somewhere where it is obvious, I am not wanted. I really wanted to treat this like a job, learn stuff, and help but it has turned into a toxic environment for entirely different reasons than my previous job that I stayed at for 6 years. \n\nIt is glaringly obvious to me that If I decide to continue showing up that I will have to address this myself, but I really did not want to cause waves. I just want to come in everyday or a few days a week and work my ass off. \n\nAs an aside, since I started losing weight and transforming myself mentally and physically, I was inadvertently using the framework built into martial arts to achieve that. This took me out of a fear-based mindset to a growth-based mindset as well. Which is why I was able to finally quit my sysadmin job and focus on something that I always wanted to do but felt I was too stupid to do \u2013 programming. \n\nThe realization that I used a framework built into martial arts to change my life led me to the conclusion that I was using a similar framework with college to do the same for my career. Now, my understanding is that I also need an internship or some type of entry level job to get my foot in the door of the industry, so to speak, correct? \n\nNot sure what to do to progress forward now. I know I need to continue learning stuff, but where should I focus that? On the languages and technologies my school exposed me to? C#, WinForms, Xamarin.Forms or move in a different direction? Blazor has been very interesting, but there are not a lot of jobs wanting that (yet). I have some experience building WordPress sites for my dojo and locally so I could spend some time to learn the technologies and languages that go with that stack better and start freelancing.  I have been seeing some stuff about Shopify being a good platform to start freelancing on. I know React is a big deal right now. I did not really want to flit from technology to technology so much that I do not really learn anything as this was a mistake I was making earlier in a different way as a sysadmin.\n\nMy Alma matter provides me access to LinkedIn Learning and Pluralsight, so I have good resources to learn things and try to watch an hour or so of something a day or more if I am not at my friend\u2019s business or working on the dojo website.  Lately I am just focusing on moving through the Pluralsight C# Path for some of the more advanced features of C# that my college courses did not touch on. I want to always be progressing forward towards bettering myself and my family\u2019s situation.\n\nSo, I am looking for advice on what to do, how to progress forward with this career change? I will link my LinkedIn and Github. \n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/james-t-mundy/\n\nhttps://github.com/hyp-fu\n\n\nFeel free to be brutal if you want to, I can take it and I am asking for it.",

        "403": "Hello.\n\nI'm a high school student who's expecting to go to Arizona State University for a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I've always been interested in STEM, but I'm also a multipotentialite, so I'm fascinated by many things :). I'd like to start preparing for a career in the tech industry, even if it's just a little on the side of everything else going on in my life.\n\nBasically, I'm deciding whether I should study software engineering (more specifically, web development\u2014or at least to start\u2014in my case) or data science. On one side, software engineering is a more well-established field, it has a clearer roadmap, and an overall safer option (e.g. more job opportunities and a larger community, as well as more resources). Moreover, I already know I like software engineering; I enjoy programming, and I've tried it before multiple times. There's just a part of me, however, that is really intrigued by data science. I've always been very analytically and scientifically minded. I love logic and argumentation. Being swarmed in data points and using it to develop logical, well-thought-out business claims sounds more fulfilling to me than software engineering. Unfortunately, it's much more of a risky move. Since data science is such an umbrella term and it still has a while to go before it's fully diversified and specialized, I'd likely feel insecure about the value of each lesson I learn. I could do an entire course on some particular technology or area of statistics and then never use it because no one data scientist has the same tasks or uses the same tools. Overall, I feel like data science would allow me to express my creativity more. Part of me wants to try out data science through an online boot camp like Dataquest, or maybe some other starter courses. I could continue learning it throughout the rest of high school. Then, maybe I could get hired as a data scientist (more likely analyst) intern in college to get some work experience. And because I'd be pursuing a CS degree, I'll be exposed to plenty of programming and software engineering principles too.\n\nAny directional insight would be appreciated (even if it's just life advice). Thank you, especially if you managed to read this whole post. If couldn't already see, I'm having a bit of an early identity crisis.",

        "406": "Hi cscareerquestions!\n\nI've posted here a few times but I've read a ton of posts here over the years and it really helped me when I was struggling to find a new job. This is my cs career journey post-college (3yr exp) and the struggles i went through. I honestly did not think I would work at a FAANG one day so for those who are currently grinding - keep going. you can do it.\n\nBackground - CS + Engineering + 2 minors degree from a top 50 CS program in the US. GPA was not amazing (low 3) but I had a very impressive academic course load. Overall, I was okay at coding. Not amazing but generally got B/B+'s during college.\n\nPost College - I managed to get a job at a financial firm out of college paying 100k a year in NYC. It was a great job where I learned a lot but I never loved the industry or how tech was viewed as an expense. After my first year, I figured out I wasn't in love with finance, and after my second year I realized I do not want to stay at my current company so I started studying.\n\nThe Grind - I initially applied to companies without much leetcode practice. To name a few - bloomberg, amazon, audible, datadog etc and I was able to get an interview. But I got DESTROYED during the technical screen. I had too much ego, I thought leetcode was a waste of time and I was smart given that I worked at a large financial firm (yup...the fintech ego really got to me) that I could figure out whatever problem I was given. That was a rude awakening. After failing all those interviews - I took a few months to relax with the goal of fully committing myself to interview prep.\n\nI studied every day after work for 4 hours and on weekends for 8 hours for 3 months. During that time I passed the technical screens for 2 FAANGS and a couple of unicorns. Did the onsite for them, and was able to receive an offer from a FAANG with 300k first-year salary.\n\nMy thoughts on leetcode - it sucks, but you have to do it. These top companies have thousands of people applying to them daily and hundreds of people competing for the same role. They need a way to filter out candidates. I think this is similar to how colleges filter candidates. They use their SAT scores + GPA to determine how 'smart' a candidate is the same way companies use leetcode style coding questions. Notice how i put 'smart' in quotes. since this doesnt measure intelligence, but dedication and hard work. No one could figure out a hard leetcode question in 40 minutes without having seen a similar problem or recognizing a pattern behind it. I repeat, NO ONE. And I think that is fair. If i were a company, to me someone who studied really hard and puts in the time + effort is equally valuable if not more valuable than someone who is a god at coding problems. 'Smart' is a combination of someone's aptitude, hard work, curiosity, and thirst to understand. You also have to be a little bit lucky that you get questions that seem familiar but I also believe that luck = preparation \\* opportunity. The more types of questions you do and understand, the more prepared you are when the opportunity arises. And to be honest, this barrier to entry for a 200-300k job a few years out of college is insanely low compared to jobs w/similar income (doctor, lawyer, etc) and all you need to do is seriously grind for a few months.\n\nHow did I approach leetcode+ system design - for leetcode do not go for numbers. go for understanding. look at each problem and think - what are the basic steps I need to solve this problem. Then try to relate those steps to data structures and algorithms/patterns you've studied/solved before. This is not a numbers game but an understanding game. You need the ability to recognize the pattern behind a problem (sliding window, 2 pointer, map + cache, dp, memoization , etc) based on problems that you've solved before with similar requirements.  \nSystem design, after going through system design primer (great resource!!), look at a large breadth of problems. you won't be expected to dive super deep into system design components so a high-level understanding of system design problems is fine (URL shortener, file storage, video streaming, social network feeds like insta or fb, etc). try to understand the pros/cons of different types of technology and why they are chosen based on requirements. You can technically make any technology 'work' but you have to be able to justify your choice during these interviews. Also, system design interviews are supposed to be open-ended conversations with the interviewer so practice talking out loud about what you're thinking and the reasoning behind your design choices.\n\nI never thought I would be working for a FAANG but it can happen if you put in the work. It's not easy but it's not as impossible as people make it seem to be. Again, luck = preparation \\* opportunity. So prepare your ass off and when the opportunity arises, you'll blow the interview out of the water!",

        "414": "\nToo often I see students doing poorly in classes because they simply weren\u2019t prepared for them. While I understand a lot of students have different situations and stuff (work, family, financial hardships), this is generally how I go about things. I was the recipient of a full ride scholarship so take SOME of the things I\u2019m saying with a grain of salt, as I don\u2019t have to worry about expenses in school and, since the pandemic started, I\u2019ve been living with my folks rent free (I did give them most of my stimulus check though lol). \n\nStudents often do poorly in classes because of simply not being prepared for the content. A lot of weed out classes at my university, or just those courses with a general tendency to be difficult to most students, often have prerequisites that aren\u2019t reflective of the prerequisite knowledge needed to do well in the course. For example, Physics I at my school requires concurrent registration in Calculus I, and Physics II at my school only requires that you have completed Calculus II, but in reality you should have Calculus I mastered before you take Physics I, and have Calculus 3 down before you take Physics II (vector calculus is the language of electromagnetism).\n\n1. Be curious. To get an overall glimpse at the subject as a whole, you need a healthy dose of curiosity. Wikipedia is a good place to start for that. Say you\u2019re reading your first Wikipedia article on thermodynamics or something. You might see at the bottom links to further Wikipedia articles on thermodynamics. In your quest you might learn that you have two general domains of thermodynamics, classical thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. You just might happen to be heavily interested in statistics, and this could open up an entire new world for you just because you allowed yourself to roam free.\n\n2. Don\u2019t always believe you\u2019re ready for a class just because you have the school prerequisites. This is a recipe for disaster. Some classes are designed to make you have a hard time. Other times, all it takes is a bad professor to take a class you\u2019re not ready for to a class you can\u2019t possibly hope to do even okay in. No reason to put yourself through that. \n\n3. Use the summer and winter breaks to do deep study in. The break time provides a nice time to get some hardcore studying done. When you self study, do plenty of practice problems and take good notes. When I self study through a textbook, I aim to take great notes and do all of the practice problems (doing all of the practice problems obviously breaks down depending on the textbook you\u2019re using and the level of the course.)\n\n4. Have a good set of resources. When you have good textbooks and stuff on subjects, you have a base reference to go back to when either another textbook or your teacher says something that confuses you. Textbooks are golden as a lot of the ones you learn out of were the same books your professors learned out of (unless they made the book, but I guarantee you they still cross reference other books.) 90% of the time, it\u2019s okay to buy older textbooks for a class. Some of my textbooks are from the late 19th and early 20th century and are far more rigorous than what courses require. I can learn things very effectively and rigorously this way. Use sites like Libgen or Zlibrary to download textbooks. Some can be found through online PDFs. Academia is also a good site to find stuff at, and the oldest textbooks can be found in online archives. If you like actual in the flesh books, use sites like eBay, AbeBooks, and Thriftbooks to buy used textbooks in good condition or new textbooks. \n\n5. YouTube videos are nice, but when you get to more advanced topics, it becomes harder to learn from them and harder to find something that suits your needs. Also, there\u2019s no way lectures can convey the same amount of information that a textbook can, and there\u2019s a reasonable limit to what a video series can cover. You\u2019re not going to learn something like tensor analysis completely using a YouTube series (Eigenchris has a good YouTube series for tensor calculus, but in general, you\u2019re going to have to supplement that subjects like these a textbook.) \n\n6. In general, do your research on the general level of \u201crigor\u201d of a subject at the level you take it at. If you\u2019re taking an upper level course on microwave theory, you should already know that you need to have a good grasp on upper level electromagnetics. Know what that calls for. A general article on a subject or subtopic on Wikipedia has references to textbooks. Look through those.\n\n7. Find community. This is good on your mental health. When you have a group of people at any level, above, below, or at the same level as you, you all have probably experienced or will experience some of the same things. SOME kind of community is pretty significant; even though the pandemic hit community became no less important. For a lot of you all I assume, this subreddit is a form of community. Even if you just come for the memes lol. A group of friends you can work with is nicer though in my opinion.\n\nThe gist is, proper preparation prevents poor performance (generally.) If you prepare beforehand and know what you\u2019re getting into, then you have a much better chance at doing well in the class, regardless of your professor. Of course this doesn\u2019t apply to classes you simply can\u2019t prepare for. Stay positive and keep doing great things!",

Even before this happened, he was already behind on his exams. Now, we are an entire year's worth of exams (and knowledge) apart.\n\nI have essentially been tutoring him for free for years (studying and doing projects \"together\" where I pull 90% of the weight) and I've noticed his gap of knowledge is wider and wider with each passing lecture.

My big mistake was agreeing to this, because I did not have the courage to shut down his adorable enthusiasm when we were talking about it, and we had already agreed a year prior to do our theses together (my University allows for two people to work on a thesis together and graduate on different dates).\n\nEver since, I've been trying to nudge him to take a step back and pick a different, easier thesis, to do on his own, without any rush, but he kept enthusiastically agreeing on this one, with me. I've been trying to push him to study harder and to focus more, and I am seriously willing to keep helping him, but this is about my degree, my future career, my future opportunities. I want to do the absolute best I can because I have very ambitious goals and, honestly, that is no longer possible if I have to drag him around all day and explain the simplest things to him. I can never ask him for any help because he never knows any answers.

I'm the one who asks him to work on the thesis and takes the train all the way to his house to study \"together\". I come up with the ideas, I do the manual work, I do the calculations, I build the mathematical models. It's all me. I feel so alone in this, which would be absolutely fine if it were **my** thesis, but it's supposed to be *ours*. I even told him exactly what he should study from start to finish in order to be able to comprehend the BEGINNING of our thesis work and I even provided him with the material to do so, giving him a big mound of high quality notes and advice, and I ask him questions throughout the day to see if he's doing any work but he's always doing something else! \"My friend is over, I'll study tomorrow. I am going live on Twitch tonight, I'll study afterwards. Hey look, we bought a VR set and these games are so cool!\". Don't get me wrong, all of these things are fine and I myself am a huge nerd, but it feels a little insulting to know he isn't even trying...\n\nWhat do I do? How do I approach him?\n\n**TL;DR:** My close friend and I agreed to work on a thesis together. He is really behind and is in no way capable of providing helpful input on our work. Instead of trying to pick up the pace, I catch him doing twitch livestreams, playing videogames, hanging out with his friend, having people over for dinner, buying a whole new VR set to play with, etc. What should I do?",

I'm from the Bay Area, so wherever I go I'm going to be moving pretty far away from home (relatively). I had my sights set on UCSD, but the other day I got off the Cal Poly waitlist and my parents want me to consider it.\n\nBoth are incredible programs, but I'm having trouble deciding between Cal Poly's \"learning by doing\" motto or UCSD's more theoretical education. My eventual goal is to go to graduate school and get a job in the aerospace industry, preferably with NASA, SpaceX, or a company of the sort, and I don't know if Cal Poly or UCSD would prepare me more for that. As for school environment, I feel like I'd fit in more at UCSD with the sort of introverted, study-focused student environment but I don't really know much about Cal Poly so I'll have to look into it more.\n\nMy question is this: Would Cal Poly's engineering program or UCSD's engineering program help me out more with my future goals?",

In that time I haven't received any formal training on how to do my job. I only know how to do the specific things that have been explained to me but lack foundational understanding of the basics like using software, standard practices, definitions, etc. I feel like a robot: I know how to follow a process but I don't know how to deviate from the process or understand the concepts behind the process. For example I mostly do ECNs and RNs for simple drawings and models, no design work. I have to make GD&amp;T annotations frequently but I have no understanding of GD&amp;T so I have to have someone tell me what tolerances should be, what symbols to use, etc every time. The company doesn't even have any training material for GD&amp;T and my university doesn't offer any classes on it either. It seems like the company (or at least my department's) idea of training is having new hires read pages and pages of technical documents and procedures themselves but no one has ever even told me what TO-s or other documents are relevant to my role.

This is a beat - a pulse - a cycle - a regularly recurring event. It's a timing event for a system. The second is defined based on hyperfine splitting, etc. The physical world is governed by such accurate timing events. This led me to what I consider to be a significant understanding.\n\nWhen it comes to decentralsied and distributed systems such as blockchain platforms, these accurate timing systems don't exist from what I can tell and there's no way to measure time with significant accuracy.\n\nIt also seems to me that blockchains themselves could function as such timing systems with blocks playing the role of beats. For example, the goal for the bitcoin blockchain is to create a new block every 10 minutes. You could say that the blockchain has a pulse of 1 beat per 600 seconds on average. This kind of simulates a heartbeat - a timing system with a variable beat. It can speed up and slow down and \"resting\" will return it to normal. What these distributed systems need is a blockchain equivalent to a fixed rate timing system like hyperfine splitting as opposed to a variable one.\n\nSo, what I'm hoping to achieve with this post is to hopefully start a discussion about this subject. Is it possible to create a blockchain type system with incentives but with a fixed rate block creation?\n\nIs such a system even necessary or could creating blocks more quickly have the same effects, for example, 1000 blocks per second instead of 1 block per 600 seconds?

Something I find somewhat frustrating is how there seems to be two different ways of working through the array. \n\nLets assume the pivot is swapped to be the last item in the list. One technique then puts a pointer `i` to be on the left side of the list, and a second pointer `j` on the right side of the list (just left of the pivot. Then `i` goes through until it lands on an item that is greater than or equal to the pivot. Then `j` goes through the list to the left until it finds an item less than the pivot. Once this happens, the items at `i` and `j` swap (or if `i` and `j` have crossed, the pivot is swapped with `i`). This is one technique, and it's one I'm comfortable with.\n\nThere also seems to be a second technique, which I don't fully understand because I haven't practiced it like I have the other one. It has both of the pointers `i` and `j` on the left side. I could be wrong, but I believe `i` starts at -1 and `j` starts at 0? Then j starts incrementing until it's found a number that is less than the pivot, then `i` is incremented, and the values at `i` and `j` are swapped. I might be misunderstanding this technique, but this method seems hella inefficient (lots of swaps). \n\n\n\nWhy are there two techniques? Does it matter which one is used?",

The project we are working on is very big (millions of lines of code) and has an very extensive build procedure and uses lots of different frameworks and components (often even in different versions at a time). The use of Lombok is justified with the argument that we can remove code this way and that everything will be much more simple.\n\nOverall for me this library just looks very useless and like a complete unnecessary use of another third party component. I really don't see the purpose of this. Most code generated on the fly can be generated with Eclipse anyway and having this code just makes me really uncomfortable in regard of source code tracking when using an debugger.

This means that Maven Central contains POMs with custom repositories that refer to a URL over HTTP. This makes downloads via such repository a target for a MITM attack. At the same time, developers are probably not aware that for some downloads an insecure URL is being used. Because uploaded POMs to Maven Central are immutable, a change for Maven was required. To solve this, we extended the mirror configuration with `&lt;blocked&gt;` parameter, and we added a new `external:http:*` mirror selector (like existing `external:*`), meaning \u201cany external URL using HTTP\u201d.\nThe decision was made to block such external HTTP repositories by default: this is done by providing a mirror in the `conf/settings.xml` blocking insecure HTTP external URLs.\n\n* Possible Domain Hijacking due to custom repositories using abandoned domains\nSonatype has analyzed which domains were abandoned and has claimed these domains.\n\n* Possible hijacking of downloads by redirecting to custom repositories\nThis one was the hardest to analyze and explain. The short story is: you\u2019re safe, dependencies are only downloaded from repositories within their context. So there are two main questions: what is the context and what is the order? The order is described on the Repository Order page. The first group of repositories are defined in the settings.xml (both user and global). The second group of repositories are based on inheritence, with ultimately the super POM containing the URL to Maven Central. The third group is the most complex one but is important to understand the term context: repositories from the effective POMs from the dependency path to the artifact. So if a dependency was defined by another dependency or by a Maven project, it will also include their repositories. In the end this is not a bug, but a design feature.\n\n# CVE-2020-13956\nApache HttpClient is a transitive dependency of Maven Resolver via Maven Wagon, so we\u2019ve updated those versions as part of this release.\n\nFor more details please read the detailed release notes:\n\nhttps://maven.apache.org/docs/3.8.1/release-notes.html",

You have not used any frameworks and coded your own implementation of web socket listener. You did not use EJB or any frameworks.

However, lately, I've struggled to find as much value from it in one specific fashion: productive discussion/debate.\n\nThe strength of this subreddit is its wide visibility/popularity, which offers a great opportunity to \"get the word out\" about some JS project or blog post on as JS (or JS adjacent) topic. But I think that's also its weakness in the sense of promoting healthy discussion. From what I can tell, most posts here are more about promoting the content (and even discussion!) elsewhere. Only a handful of posts per week seem to generate a good amount of discussion, and the rest end up basically just \"ads\" for a project or blog post.\n\nSo I wanted to experiment with an additional space for discussion and debate to happen around JS development topics.\n\nThe newly launched /r/JSdev subreddit has a different, complimentary purpose to /r/javascript. Its \"rules\" are a little different, and I think the culture and tone of discussion will also be different as a result.\n\nIf you want to promote your project or blog post, /r/javascript here is still the best place. And if you want to learn about JS or get help, /r/LearnJavascript is likely the best place. But if you're interested in a bit more focus on healthy discussion and debate about the practice of developing with JS, and how it's used to make experiences better, I would invite you to *also* join /r/JSdev.

A webapp is fine. The problem is that I don't know what kind of UI I can possibly build for this project and I would like to hear your suggestion. Here are some ideas of my own:\n\n* Create a map of the US with the companies as dots there, with their labor skill score and their dividends amount.  There will be a slide bar under the map so you can slide around the year, from 1999 to 2017 - so above is the map, below is the year, and you can slide freely to see how dividend and assets changes! The UI can look similar to this video's idea regarding the slide bar:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUwmA3Q0\\_OE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUwmA3Q0_OE)\n   * The drawback is obviously it is somewhat complexed. The other thing, if I go with this idea, is how to display two variables (or more) for a company on the map.\n* Another idea is to have have an put field for the company's assets and have the machine trying to predict the outcome dividends. Since I use 2 algorithms for now, I can have it displays for the user: For your input \\[input here\\], logistic regression says blah blah and decision tree says blah blah. Essentially, it tries to predict whether or not the company pays dividends given their assets and so on.\n   * The drawback...well, not really a drawback, but it is too simple perhaps.\n\nWhat would you guys do if you are given a week to work on the UI and with this idea?

Humans do this by coming up with a short program, or algorithm, that explains the few data points in a compact way. DreamCoder emulates this by using neural guided search over a language of primitives, a library, that it builds up over time. By doing this, it can iteratively construct more and more complex programs by building on its own abstractions and therefore solve more and more difficult tasks in a few-shot manner by generating very short programs that solve the few given datapoints.

A spectrogram is computed using magnitudes of the Short-Time Fourier Transform with a **window** size of 25 ms, a window hop of 10 ms, and a periodic Hann window.\n\n A mel spectrogram is computed by mapping the spectrogram to 64 mel bins covering the range 125-7500 Hz. A stabilized log mel spectrogram is computed by applying log(mel-spectrum + 0.001) where the offset is used to avoid taking a logarithm of zero. \n\nThese features are then **framed** into 50%-overlapping examples of 0.96 seconds, where each example covers 64 mel bands and 96 frames of **10 ms each**.\"\n\nSo, my question is why each frame length 10 ms ( \"where each example covers 64 mel bands and 96 frames of **10 ms each\"** )? But not 25 ms? I think that because 25 ms is a length of a window of STFT, while 10ms is only a \"window hop\".\n\nThanks in advance. Wish you a good day.",

At the same time evolutionary algorithms (EA) have been proven to be competitive with standard RL algorithms on certain problems, while being simpler and more scalable.\n\nRecent advances on EA have led to the development of algorithms like Novelty Search and Quality Diversity, capable of efficiently addressing complex exploration problems and finding a wealth of different policies. All these results and developments have sparked a strong renewed interest in such population-based computational approaches.\n\nNevertheless, even if EAs can perform well on hard exploration problems they still suffer from low sample efficiency. This limitation is less present in RL methods, notably because of sample reuse, while on the contrary they struggle with hard exploration settings. The complementary characteristics of RL algorithms and EAs have pushed researchers to explore new approaches merging the two in order to harness their respective strengths while avoiding their shortcomings.\n\nThe goal of the workshop is to foster collaboration, share perspectives, and spread best practices within our growing community at the intersection between RL and EA.\n\nThe topics at the heart of the workshop include:\n\n* Evolutionary reinforcement learning\n* Evolution strategies\n* Population-based methods for policy search\n* Neuroevolution\n* Hard exploration and sparse reward problems\n* Deceptive reward\n* Novelty and diversity search methods\n* Divergent search\n* Sample-efficient direct policy search\n* Intrinsic motivation, curiosity\n* Building or designing behaviour characterizations\n* Meta-learning, hierarchical learning\n* Evolutionary AutoML\n* Open-ended learning\n\nAutors are invited to submit **new original work**, or\u00a0**new perspectives on recently published work**\u00a0 on those topics.

Note that while the HOTT algorithm is unsupervised the datasets in the paper are labeled, otherwise a benchmark would not be possible.\n\nThe SIF papers mostly deal with the STS datasets which are not long texts. p-SIF has a benchmark on the Reuters dataset, but uses a SVM supervised approach. Interestingly, the HOTT paper finds that SIF does not perform well with the k-NN approach with 0.79 normalized error.\n\nIn many cases BERT requires pre-training and if it does not, its max or average pooled performance (pooling over BERT layers) appears to be worse than glove embeddings ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06467](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06467) page 114).\n\nI have also not been able to find unsupervised benchmarks for Doc2Vec, Universal Sentence Encoder (USE).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is additionally the question of how to calculate the similarity once the embedding is obtained (e.g., [https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N19-1100.pdf](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N19-1100.pdf)) but that is out of scope for this question unless it affects comparison between unsupervised benchmarks (e.g., the k-NN approach can use various distance metrics which may affect accuracy).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf the benchmarks in HOTT are representative and no other methods exist that perform substantially better it is tempting to make the conclusion that tf-idf is still a strong approach since it is so simple to implement and understand (it is certainly simpler than HOTT). If that is the case I think it is a remarkable conclusion given the deep learning developments in the last 5-10 years.\n\nedit: added \"(pooling over BERT layers)\"",

Yet we know little about how these changes have affected the people that research and practice computer vision: we as a community spend so much effort trying to replicate the abilities of humans, but so little time considering the impact of this work on ourselves. In this paper, we report on a study in which we asked computer vision researchers and practitioners to write stories about emotionally-salient events that happened to them. Our analysis of over 50 responses found tremendous affective (emotional) strain in the computer vision community. While many describe excitement and success, we found strikingly frequent feelings of isolation, cynicism, apathy, and exasperation over the state of the field. This is especially true among people who do not share the unbridled enthusiasm for normative standards for computer vision research and who do not see themselves as part of the \u201cincrowd.\u201d Our findings suggest that these feelings are closely tied to the kinds of research and professional practices now expected in computer vision. We argue that as a community with significant stature, we need to work towards an inclusive culture that makes transparent and addresses the real emotional toil of its members.",

Well, they're pretty nasty pollutants, which frequently affect human health, especially over long exposure periods. Perhaps concentrations should affect where we build homes more than they do, for example? They're also useful proxies for various types of human activity.\n\n**Carbon monoxide** can be deadly in high concentrations, as it binds to hemoglobin, and makes it so that one's blood can't carry as much oxygen. Created via combustion of fossil fuels.\n\n**Nitrogen dioxide** is one of the results of road traffic and other fossil fuel combustion, is one of the precursors for other harmful pollutants such as ozone and particulates, and plays a role in the formation of acid rain (it becomes nitric acid). It's also generally correlated with exposure to other byproducts of road traffic, many of which have been linked to respiratory illnesses and systemic inflammation, which can lead to a whole host of other health issues.\n\n**Ozone** is a powerful oxidant, which makes it so that it can cause damage to respiratory tissues. It also attacks various polymers like rubber, eventually causing it to crack. It's formed primarily from photochemical reactions between nitrogen oxides (like NO2) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). High concentrations aren't limited to urban areas, however, and it can travel hundreds of miles downwind from the source.\n\nFinally, **sulfur dioxide**. Formed largely by the combustion of fossil fuels with high levels of sulfur, as well as volcanic activity. It's a precursor to acid rain (it becomes sulfuric acid). Sulfur dioxide is known to be at least mildly toxic, and can be hazardous in high concentrations. Long term exposure to low concentrations can also be problematic. The amount of sulfur in fossil fuels vary widely by type - automotive gasoline has much less than bunker fuel commonly used by container ships, for example.\n\nIf you'd like to download any part of these, you can filter down to the parts you care part via the lat/long filter (button on the map to select area) or by year, via sliders.

This technology allows the analysis of the electromagnetic spectrum in bands close to the visible spectrum. As a result, there is a large amount of information that can be analyzed in order to make predictions about a factor such as the quality of the sample. \u00a0This advantage of being able to quickly analyze the material without having to destroy the samples have made it so that, in recent times, this kind of equipment has been moved from the laboratory to portable devices in some cases as small as a credit card. Therefore, numerous applications have been developed under the umbrella of this technology, such as analysis of sewer water, determination of food safety, diagnosis of construction material, support on medical and vet diagnosis; the number of applications is near endless.\n\nHowever, this blossom of applications usually goes along with the requirement of a model which identifies and uses the information in the captured spectra. The relationship between both factors is usually non-linear and complex, so it is necessary to use machine learning techniques to obtain it. Although, it has usually been performed through an analytical process, currently, the application of machine learning has been a step forward in terms of the precision and adjustment of the results. As NIR and machine learning are multidisciplinary technologies, many fields of science and industry could benefit from their use.\n\nEspecially, if we focus on feature selection of the bands on the spectra that contain the information required to solve the problem, the application of machine learning needs a process of adjustment to optimize the performance. The aim of this Special Issue is to present the latest advances that have been made in this field, combining both techniques, as well as to show the remaining challenges and the future in this area of research. That is why this Special Issue solicits submissions in, but not limited to, the following areas:\n\n* Selection of features or bands of the NIR spectra, with a special interest in those applications using nano-scale NIR scanners due to its limited operational range;\n* Studies of different preprocessing techniques and comparison with automatic features extraction process, such as PCA, LDA, evolutionary computation;\n* Developments combining cloud computing, fog computing or edge computing with the processing of NIR spectra in different industrial processes;\n* Application and comparative of the latest approaches of machine learning techniques, such as deep learning or ensemble models;\n* Works with a particular interest to cover the explainable artificial intelligence in the frame of decision-making using NIR data and machine learning.\n\nKeywords:  \n\nsignal processing; near-infrared; machine learning; artificial neural networks; support vector machines; k-nearest neighbour; Na\u00efve Bayes; random forest; ensemble models; evolutionary computation; explainable artificial intelligence; ensemble methods; deep learning; feature extraction; Principal Component Analysis (PCA); food security; material analysis; drug identification; medical diagnosis; vet diagnosis; Internet of things (IoT)",

Here, we propose scaling a deep contextual language model with unsupervised learning to sequences spanning evolutionary diversity. We find that without prior knowledge, information emerges in the learned representations on fundamental properties of proteins such as secondary structure, contacts, and biological activity. We show the learned representations are useful across benchmarks for remote homology detection, prediction of secondary structure, long-range residue\u2013residue contacts, and mutational effect. Unsupervised representation learning enables state-of-the-art supervised prediction of mutational effect and secondary structure and improves state-of-the-art features for long-range contact prediction.\n\n*Abstract*\n\nIn the field of artificial intelligence, a combination of scale in data and model capacity enabled by unsupervised learning has led to major advances in representation learning and statistical generation. In the life sciences, the anticipated growth of sequencing promises unprecedented data on natural sequence diversity. Protein language modeling at the scale of evolution is a logical step toward predictive and generative artificial intelligence for biology. To this end, we use unsupervised learning to train a deep contextual language model on 86 billion amino acids across 250 million protein sequences spanning evolutionary diversity. The resulting model contains information about biological properties in its representations. The representations are learned from sequence data alone. The learned representation space has a multiscale organization reflecting structure from the level of biochemical properties of amino acids to remote homology of proteins. Information about secondary and tertiary structure is encoded in the representations and can be identified by linear projections. Representation learning produces features that generalize across a range of applications, enabling state-of-the-art supervised prediction of mutational effect and secondary structure and improving state-of-the-art features for long-range contact prediction.\n\nPaper: https://www.pnas.org/content/118/15/e2016239118",

        "1004": "Hi. I've recently been working on making a setup where I would be able to train and test a machine learning agent for a TCG roguelike game called Slay the Spire. I'd like to share the process and my current status in that project so that I can receive feedback for improvement, and maybe help others who face problems similar to what I went through.\n\nFor this project, I had to solve the following problems.\n\n1. Establish connection with the game process, or at least mimic something similar.\n2. Find a way to design a model that is capable of making different types of decisions with different format of inputs depending on game state. The model must be able to handle different tasks ranging from selecting card reward to choosing whether throwing a potion at a particular enemy would be beneficial.\n3. Find a way to properly reward that model.\n4. Run as much games as possible in parallel at any given moment in time\n\nThe first problem proved to be a lot easier than I expected. There was already a mod called Communication Mod that practically solved the problem for me the moment I discovered it. It allowed connection and communication between the game process and any arbitrary external python script through stdin and stdout. I just fiddled with it to make it work, and afterwards I was good to go.\n\nSecond problem was a bit more tricky, and I'm not quite happy with how I solved it. I just divided the game into distinct situations that requires its own distinct format of input to make its own distinct type of decision. Then, I just made a neural network for every single one of them. I can't shake off the feeling that there might be a more efficient way of doing it, but I'm still a noob.\n\nThe way I solved the second problem made solving the third problem a bit more difficult. I wasn't training just one single net, but a collection of nets that together plays the game by trying to predict how beneficial playing some action in some situation would be. I was, however, able to solve it through the following process.\n\n1. Add one extra net to a collection of nets, whose purpose is to predict how much score this AI would get by the end of the game, based on a perfect snapshot of current situation.\n2. While the agent is playing a game, create a snapshot at set moments in the game and record every decisions made between each snapshots.\n3. When the game is over, assign a label to every snapshots created during that game with a score equal to what it got by the game was over.\n4. Train the snapshot net with the label.\n5. Label every decision points with snapshot\\_score(after) - snapshot\\_score(before).\n6. Train the nets with the label.\n\nThe fourth problem was the most tricky but most enjoyable one to solve. As we all know, more data is usually better when doing machine learning. My data was being generated during training by my agent actually playing the game, so if I could make the agent play more games simultaneously then I would get more data. To do that, however, I had to be able to launch and run multiple games at once.\n\nI was able to achieve that by using virtual machines. Basically, I would create virtual machines as worker nodes that actually runs the game, then make those games communicate with their local python script which would establish socket connection with my main machine that actually runs the agent. But there's one catch. I didn't have enough computing resources to do that in large scale.\n\nMy solution to that was google compute engine in their cloud platform. Each instance of it was a virtual machine that can be connected to through the internet, so it was almost perfect for my use. However, putting a GPU to my instances was not practical due to cost, and without it the game run abysmally slow due to rendering issues.\n\nI solved that by just making my own small mod for the game that applies a bytepatch to the code to disable rendering calls in its main loop. It was surprisingly easy due to the game being written in java. However, I still couldn't run the game on cli because it required a window manager. And I wanted to automate the process without having to open up the desktop for all the worker nodes and manually traversing through the gui to launch the game. \n\nThe solution for that problem proved to be deceptively simple. Just attach a command to the gnome-session-properties such that when it starts it automatically fires the game. Then, use ssh connection to open up a new gnome session, which can be done in cli or by a bash script. When things required a reset I could just close the gnome sessions which also can be done via cli and start it back up again.\n\nThat's about it!",

        "1008": "Computer vision and natural language processing get most of the limelight in the deep learning world, and rightfully so. But, as someone working in another field that fell for the deep learning hype, too, I often see problems that have no direct equivalent in CV or NLP. Nevertheless, people try to adopt successful methods from these fields.\n\nThis sometimes leads to results that are not meaningful at all because the researchers don't take the time to adapt the methods properly to the field. Often, datasets are much smaller or have samples that are part of the same group (e.g. steps in a time series). There are enough papers, where one part of a time series is put into the train and the other part into the test set.  I wrote a [blog post](https://krokotsch.eu/research/2021/04/07/One-Eyed-Data-Scientist.html) about one of these problems in my field, predictive maintenance, and how it leads the whole line of research astray.\n\n**So my question would be: how is the state of DL in your field that is not CV or NLP, and does it suffer from blindly copying approaches from them, too?**",

I see it as a potential information theft would have to set up a server somewhere, make a client on your computer, and then send the data from the client to the server. It seems to me that it would be very easy as the victim to decompile the program and find their ip from how they connect to their server. With a person's IP, you can get fairly close to where they are located, and it seems to me kinda stupid to create a beacon if you are committing a crime.

        "1121": "While benchmarking some specific class in my code I realized that using `std::forward_list` instead of `std::vector` for its backing storage resulted in greater performance when storing a small number of elements.\n\nThis sounded counter-intuitive and I watched enough Chandler Carruth's talks to know that `std::list`/`std::forward_list` is almost always the worst choice of container when speed is concerned.\n\nI tried a few things to improve the performance using `std::vector`, including reserving some memory beforehand but it was still beaten by `std::forward_list`.\nSo I opened up compiler explorer and tried to figure out what was actually going on. I quickly realized that when using `std::forward_list` the code was much better optimized with around half the instruction count compared to the `std::vector` version and almost no function calls. I guess this explain the performance difference I observed.\n\nI then tried to get the smallest possible piece of code that would highlight this difference and I ended up with [this](https://godbolt.org/z/WxrdG63rG). It's just a `push_back(12)`/`push_front(12)` and then returning `back()`/`front()`. You can see that the `std::forward_list` version is completely optimized and simply returns 12 while the `std::vector` version performs memory allocation/deallocation while still unconditionally returning 12.\n\nIs there a fundamental reason why `std::forward_list` gets better optimized than `std::vector`? Or is it just due to inconsistent optimizations?\n\nAlso, since memory allocations are kept with `std::vector` while the return value is harcoded I guess that the compiler assumes that calling `new`/`delete` may have side effects. But if it's the case, why assuming that there aren't side effects with `std::forward_list` and removing the calls?",

My professional experience to date has always been working on existing projects with custom build tools, so I'm not very familiar with the defacto standards for real projects.\n\nI'm looking to compile application software for windows and potentially down the line Linux as well. \nOne of the requirements is that all of the tooling be self hosted.\nI am looking at using clang as my primary compiler, with ninja build scripts generated by either meson or cmake. 3rd party libraries like Qt, boost, etc including binary only redistributables I'm intending to manage with Conan, using an Artifacfory CE server that we host internally. Unit testing will likely be done through Boost.Test, although I'm not too worried about the test framework at this stage.\n\nOne thing I would really like to be able to support is having a package in Conan/Artifacfory that is a bundled up version of the compiler I am intending to target, and having the build scripts be able to fetch that compiler and store it in a Conan cache on disk, then call to it when I want to compile. Ideally this would mean that everyone is using the same version of the same compiler, and wouldn't have to install the compiler themselves.\nDoes anyone know if this is possible with my proposed environment?

I have been trying to figure out how to use it for 3 days, and I am starting to understand things a little.\n\nI first tried using the std::experimental::net that comes with gcc in Ubuntu 20.04, but it turned out to be incomplete. In order to make the code work, I had to use this github repository instead: https://github.com/chriskohlhoff/networking-ts-impl. The last commit was 2 years ago. Is it the recommended implementation?\n\nI tried to teach myself how to use it by following the boost::asio tutorial. It was a bit difficult because of the differences between the two libraries, but I managed to translate the asio tutorial samples without using any boost library.\n\nI was surprised that I had to pass the port number as a string to net::ip::tcp::resolver::resolve. Wouldn't it be much better to use an int override, both in terms of implementation and usage of this function? I really don't like having to convert my port number to a string. Is there a way to do it without the conversion?\n\nI also dislike the enable_shared_from_this trick used in the boost::asio examples. It looks like a dirty anti-pattern. I feel it is possible to do things much more cleanly without it. I tried to implement an echo server differently: the server keeps a std::list&lt;connection&gt;, and the completion handlers are members of the server class instead of the connection class. They take an iterator to the list as parameter, and can cleanly erase the connection from the list. I feel it is much cleaner and simpler than sending connections from lambda to lambda, and using tricks to let them commit suicide by themselves. Is there any advantage of enable_shared_from_this compared to what I do?\n\nThe scope of boost::asio is wider than networking, and I am surprised that C++ seems to be restricting it to networking. I understand that standardizing a library is a lot of work, and taking care of networking first should have priority. But why not call it std::asio instead, and leave the possibility to add asynchronous file operation to it later?",

I'm not sure this is yet another case of C++ getting the defaults wrong but having the option to note the lack of aliasing would be useful.\n\nHere are some timings in microseconds from my ye olde Haswell laptop showing some utility for one particular kernel (100k repeats for the distribution):\n\n||||normal|||restrict||Is normal|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|data type|vector size|10%|median|90%|10%|median|90%|slower?|\n||||||||||\n|i32|64|.018|.020|.039|.015|.016|.031|25%|\n||256|.065|.076|.145|.058|.060|.111|26%|\n||4096|1.304|1.432|2.163|1.177|1.241|1.846|15%|\n||65536|25.474|28.758|38.147|22.467|23.238|25.523|24%|\n||||||||||\n|f32|64|.070|.077|.154|.066|.070|.129|9%|\n||256|.290|.291|.624|.288|.289|.569|1%|\n||4096|4.494|4.717|5.341|4.337|4.473|5.384|5%|\n||65536|84.910|92.715|149.789|73.627|82.019|116.101|13%|\n||||||||||\n|i8|4096|.638|.684|.957|.556|.563|.759|21%|\n|i16|4096|.663|.695|1.055|.599|.618|1.123|13%|\n|i64|4096|3.010|3.435|4.915|2.755|2.879|4.045|19%|\n|f64|4096|4.442|4.495|5.483|4.344|4.428|4.974|2%|\n|i128|4096|14.504|15.743|23.147|13.674|15.474|22.099|2%|\n\nThe example kernel used here looks like this:\n\n    template&lt;i64 N&gt;\n    R foo(pT restrict a, pT restrict b, pT restrict c) { \n      R result{0}; \n      for( auto i = 0; i&lt;N; ++i) { \n        a[i]   =  a[i]*b[i] + c[i]; \n        b[i]   =  c[i]*b[i] + a[i]; \n        result += a[i] + b[i]; \n      } \n      return result; \n    }\n\nAssembly generation here FWIW: [https://godbolt.org/z/v9q5sdcx5](https://godbolt.org/z/v9q5sdcx5)\n\nThe most recent standard proposal that may help regards disjoint memory: [http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p1296r0.pdf](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p1296r0.pdf)\n\nPrevious papers looked at activating the C restrict keyword for C++, such as: [http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n3988.pdf](http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n3988.pdf)\n\nMost major compilers support a \"restrict\" qualifier, such as \\_\\_restrict\\_\\_ or \\_\\_restrict, etc: gcc, msvc, intel(edg), hp(edg), ibm, nvcc, ti, clang.\n\nYMMV, but think about using restrict for your performance-sensitive code if it is safe to do so.

        "1162": "I am writing a new build system [HMake](https://github.com/HassanSajjad-302/HMake) on top of CMake. Basically, HMake is a C++ library that generates a CMakeLists.txt file. There are very important features missing in it currently. Though I believe they can be added. I was able to generate two trivial CMakeLists.txt files which work for my two projects. One example is the following.\n\nFor following c++ code\n\n        executable HMake(\"HMake\", file(\"main.cpp\"));\n        for (auto x : fs::directory_iterator(\"src\"))\n        {\n            HMake.sourceFiles.emplace_back(file(x));\n        }\n        directory headerDirectory(\"header\");\n        //IDD is for includeDirectoryDependency\n        IDD headerFolderDependency{headerDirectory, dependencyType::PUBLIC};\n        HMake.includeDirectoryDependencies.emplace_back(headerFolderDependency);\n        HMake.setRunTimeOutputDirectory(directory(\"/home/hassan/Projects/HMake\"));\n        //This is the CMakeLists.txt file\n        instructionsFileMain mainFile(HMake, projectDetails(CmakeVersion(), \"HMake\"));\n        std::cout&lt;&lt;mainFile.getScript();\n\nThis generates the following CMakeLists.txt file\n\n    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0.0)\n    \n    project(HMake LANGUAGES CXX)\n    \n    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)\n    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)\n    \n    add_executable(HMake\n            main.cpp\n            src/executable.cpp\n            src/projectdetails.cpp\n            src/file.cpp\n            src/sourcefiles.cpp\n            src/directory.cpp\n            src/instructionsFileMain.cpp\n            src/cxx_standard.cpp\n            src/cxxStandard.cpp\n            src/libraryDependency.cpp\n            src/library.cpp\n            )\n    \n    target_include_directories(HMake\n            PUBLIC header\n            )\n    \n    set_target_properties(HMake PROPERTIES\n            RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY /home/hassan/Projects/HMake)\n\nThis is basically the same CMakeLists.txt file that I am using to build the library. Other example is a bit more complex and can be found in my project.\n\nThis lacks many important features e.g. I am providing hardcoded paths instead of variables like `CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR` and `CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR.` These and many other missing features I think can be provided using the c++ interface.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nThis is proof that c++ can be used instead of CMake to specify instructions for build system generators. \n\nBasically, we will embed a c++ compiler in HMake. Then instead of writing the CMakeLists.txt file in CMake language, you will write CMakeLists.txt in c++. Headers related to the build system will be provided by default. Other functions that help in installation or constants or enums that will be used to specify compiler version, c++ version, platform, platform version, architecture, etc will also be provided. This file will then be compiled and executed. At the end of its execution, we will have a data structure that has information that will be used for generating the build system. e.g. in the example above in the last line, we are printing the contents of the CMakeLists.txt file. Instead of this printing of the CMakeLists.txt file we just generate the build system. This is approach 1.\n\nOr we can just embed the C++ parser and then use constexpr vector and string. This way we won't need to embed the compiler backend.\n\nThese are long-term goals. Short term goal is to support the most features of CMake in my build system using the optimal c++ interface. So that real-world projects can use my library to generate CMakeLists.txt file by writing c++ code. Once this is done, we can just embed the compiler and eliminate the middle stage of generating the CMakeLists.txt file.",

        "1171": "Before reading, note that I'm not really qualified to tell anybody how anything ought to work. Many of these ideas build on top of each other, so if one piece is ill-formed, the house of cards falls. I'm as much looking for corrections in my understanding of C++, and programming languages in general, as I am trying to express an idea that I like a lot.\n\nThe simplest way I can think to express the idea is as a lambda with value semantics.\n\nFor instance, if I were to create and modify a variable like this:\n\n    magi int x = 5;\n    x = x * x;\n\nThen `x` would essentially be an unused function expression similar to:\n\n    auto x = [](){ int x = 5;\n                   x = x * x;\n                   return x; };\n\nAssigning another variable the value of `x` would be equivalent to a call of that function. The intended application of this keyword is to make parameter passing easier.\n\nFor example:\n\n    struct Customer{ std:string first, last;\n                     Customer(magi std::string f, magi std::string l); };\n\nThe `Customer` constructor doesn't care how `first` and `last` are created, only that they do get created. So why constrain yourself by passing that constructor a complete object, rather than a set of instructions? Here, you can avoid dealing with the combinatorics of const ref/value, and actually only create each string once. From the frame of reference of `std::cin`, first and last are not imaginary, the call just happens at a different time.\n\n    magi std::string first, last;\n    std::cin &gt;&gt; first; std::cin &gt;&gt; last;\n    Customer c(first, last);\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nJust about everywhere in the programming world, it's been decided that values are safer to work with than pointers. We have constructors, which make sure objects are in a valid state before use, and constructors can be parameterized.\n\nThe problem is that a constructor introduces a function scope, and somehow, the idea of what the members should look like needs to be passed through that scope. As long as the idea of an object is tied to actual state in memory, you can't pass that idea through a function scope as a value without first making the object in the wrong place.\n\nI should say that unless stated otherwise, I'm talking in a context without optimization magic.\n\nConsider two types of knowledge you might have about an object in a given scope, and therefor four possible situations you might be in:\n\n1. You know where the object belongs and what it should look like\n2. You know where the object belongs, but not what it should look like.\n3. You don't know where the object belongs, but know what it should look like.\n4. You neither know where the object belongs, nor what it should look like.\n\nIn the last three of those situations, working with values requires that you make at least one redundant object (of course, if it weren't for references, the number would be bounded by call depth). Constructors, and functions like `std::vector&lt;T&gt;::push_back` fall into categories 2 or 4, while the caller of those functions is in category 3. Unless I'm being naive, the rule for using imaginaries is simple, and without caveat; If you're missing either of these pieces of information, that information should be represented by an imaginary.\n\nI consider `std::move`, aka `maybe destructive soft copy`, to be a bandaid rather than a solution to this problem. Higher level programming languages sidestep this problem by just heap allocating everything, living with the indirection and cache-misses, then garbage collecting later.\n\nIf you have a way to decouple expression of an object as a stateful value, and creation of that object in memory, then that unlocks fine control of a huge chunk of the problem space of object lifetime without resorting to using pointers to uninitialized memory.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nGoing further, I'd like to refine some ideas surrounding implementation. I guess I'll start with the least exciting ideas first.\n\nI expressed the idea of an imaginary as a lambda expression which returns a value, but then you have to reason about copy-elision(RVO), and whether it's actually possible at all times. If the feature doesn't guarantee the object is only created once, then that defeats the purpose, so I think of it as a function which takes a pointer to uninitialized memory, and constructs the object in that place.\n\nI also consider implementation as a literal callable function a last resort. One obvious pain point is that in many cases, it can't possibly be worth calling functions to avoid copies, such as when parameters could be easily passed in registers.\n\n    struct Point3D{ int x, y, z;\n                    Point3D(magi int x_, magi int y_, magi int z_)\n                        : x(x_), y(y_), z(z_){} };\n\nOne minor tweak could be aggregating multiple paramters into a single actual function. At that point a single \"aggregated imaginary\" is doing all the actual work, which hints at the next optimization.\n\nThe `Point3D` constructor is redundant. Not in a way that there's any need for an optimizer to reason about side effects before deleting it, but obviously completely redundant by the very nature of its definition.\n\nIn fact, any function which takes imaginary parameters, and only passes them along to other functions is also redundant. I think this could be worded in the standard as something like \"Any function which forwards imaginary parameters, but otherwise contains no executable code, is not a function, but a contract enforcing that other functions be called.\". This way, if you nest many classes through composition, you don't have to deal with any pains of potentially copying/moving objects through many levels of constructors. Each constructor just \"collects\" the requirements of the members.\n\nSo if the class constructor never needs to exist, then all you're left with is an in-line function expression which only modifies members of a local, which can be completely elided as well. This preserves encapsulation, and explicitly constructs objects in place, without the need for an optimizer to do any magic. However, afaik, IILEs do not get inlined without optimization flags, but maybe there could be an exception here?.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf for whatever reason you're still with me, I have one more, possibly ridiculous, idea that I'd like some clarification on.\n\nSuppose a constructor, or a function such as `std::vector&lt;T&gt;::push_back(magi T val)` can't be inlined, and therefor, the imaginary must exist as an actual callable \"something\".\n\nConsidering `push_back` as it exists today, if you were to construct and move an object, then the instructions to construct that object already exist on the stack. In a world with imaginaries, can you just use those instructions? In other words, can a caller and the callee,  `push_back`, cooperatively bounce the instruction pointer back and forth? That way the imaginary never has to be \"outlined\" so to speak. It might save the compiler having to generate a bunch of callable types for every usage of `push_back`. The \"inline pseudo-function\" which represents the imaginary may have to make another call, growing the stack.\n\nI'm not sure how to think about how this would effect things like exceptions/stack unwinding/whatever. You could envision a chain of dependent imaginaries running all the way down the stack to `main`, acting as a reversed stack within a stack, each of them calling other functions, growing and shrinking the actual stack before moving on, then \"returning\" back up the stack.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTouching more on subjective motivation for this; I really don't like the extent to which we rely on the optimizer. I think the difference in speed between optimized and unoptimized code is unreasonable. If it were easier to express more efficient code, this wouldn't be a problem. I don't remember where I heard/read this, but supposedly the no-opt:opt run time ratio in C is around 2-4:1, where in C++ it's more like 30:1 or worse.\n\nTo be clear, the thing I'm most interested in is the ability to express that an object shouldn't be created yet. In the end, this can open the door to more optimization magic, which is great.\n\nCode bloat from generating nearly identical functions can be a problem and lead to longer compile times. This may be reduced if you can reduce the scope of responsibility of those functions to not include objects they shouldn't touch.\n\nReasoning about which incantation is going to produce the most optimal code is hard, and I'm dumb. I need it to be easier. Just because I'm dumb doesn't mean my cpu cycles don't matter.\n\nI don't like `std::move`. At least not in the way that we're forced to use it. Moving something from one data structure to another is fine, but most of our uses seem like an abuse.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI also really don't like using functions like `std::vector&lt;T&gt;::emplace_back`. To be frank, I'm embarassed to be seen hanging out with myself knowing that I've used it. It's like saying \"who needs recursion when you can just nest as many ifs and loops as you need\", but then getting tired, stopping after two, and declaring all other use cases invalid. If I pass arguments intended for the emplaced object's constructor to `emplace_back`, I still need to construct *those* objects. When do I get `emplace_emplace_back`?\n\nIf you `push_back` an imaginary, `emplace_back` is obviously unnecessary, but there's still an issue I think can be dealt with. While many things may be inlined or optimized away, The template code *expresses* that for any given type, a `push_back` function must be generated (if used). Reasoning about what actually results after optimization is difficult.\n\nGiven that `push_back` is no longer concerned with the construction of the object, the only bit of information it actually needs in order to do its duty of keeping the \"end\" pointer consistent is `sizeof(T)`, correct? If there were some private member function with a size parameter, `void push_back&lt;T&gt;(magi T val, size_t size);`, then, ideally, it could represent a single implementation for all `T`, as long as the compiler recognizes it contains no type-specific code (where in the process could this happen? Must the symbols exist at link time? Maybe there is a better way to express this). Then, a public member function `void push_back&lt;T&gt;(magi T val){ push_back(val, sizeof(T)); }` contains no executable code, doesn't need to exist, and only enforces correct usage of the private member. It's basically a glorified macro with extra super powers. The only thing left out is the allocator, but then you're just generating a `push_back` per allocator instead of per type.\n\nedit:\n\nA deleted comment mentioned that in my \"single implementation push_back\" example, a reallocation requires that all of the objects be moved, which means you can't easily get rid of all type-specific code. This legitimately slipped past me despite seeming obvious. Maybe you could parameterize all the things, but at that point why bother? It's one of those ill-formed ideas I warned y'all about.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnyway, this was a lot more long winded than I intended it to be. I guess I've collected a lot of thoughts on this. There is more to consider, such as the order of code execution, side effects, multiple calls, etc. but I've said too much already (i.e. I was going to tell you about the problems, but got tired and stopped).\n\nI would enjoy reading how a feature like this might work with, or be incompatible with, the kind of code you write.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\ntl;dr if you wrap the concept of an object in a burrito and pass the message along it's considered good.\n\nreal tl;dr There exists between all function scopes, a problem-space, bounded by what a class instance might be, and where it might belong. Imaginary/concrete variable duality gives you freedom to fully navigate that space.",

The trouble is at least two classes of objects are stored as such:\n\nunordered\\_map&lt;string, vector&lt;unique\\_ptr&lt;Doodad&gt;&gt;&gt; doodads\n\nDoodads are just a game object. Their function isn't so important here. However, this data structure lets me have two doodads named, say, \"statue\",  one with an index of 0, another with an index of 1. The scripting system can query the engine for how many objects of a particular name exist and access them by \"index\". This work great for the engine and there are no issues with it whatsoever.\n\nThe trouble is this is not so good for the level editor because it is not so easily iterated on as a whole list of objects.

That seems to indicate that each level of recursion makes the stack grow by 1MB.

That is actually a tricky question, as the definition of AI is a topic of hot debate among people both inside and outside of the field. Broadly speaking, it is about machines that behave intelligently in some way, but this means different things to different people. \n\nMost notably, there is the distinction between machines that are (at least) as intelligent as humans (artificial general intelligence / AGI) and machines that are capable of performing one task very well that would require intelligence if a human did it (narrow AI / ANI). When people outside the field think of \"AI\", they often think of AGI and possibly very humanlike AGI, often inspired by sci-fi books, shows and movies. However, today we are unable to create such systems. What we *can* do is create magnificently useful software and robotic tools, and that is what most of the professional AI field does. So to most professionals \"AI\" tends to refer to ANI. This can lead to a lot of confusion. \n\nAnother important thing to realize is that AI is an incredibly broad field that touches on Computer Science, Cognitive Science, Mathematics, Philosophy, Neuroscience, Linguistics and many others, and includes many subfields like Machine Learning, Robotics, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Knowledge-Based Systems, Evolutionary Algorithms, Search and Planning. Many of these have subreddits dedicated to them as well (see [this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/wiki/related-subreddits)). /r/artificial is about all of these things. For instance, posts about computer vision are very welcome here, although the poster should realize people here will have a broader AI background than the specialists on /r/computervision, which might affect the kind of discussion that emerges. \n\nOn /r/artificial we welcome anyone who is interested in intelligent and respectful discussion of AI in any form.

However, adapting them to articulated shapes is non-trivial. Existing approaches learn a backward warp field that maps deformed to canonical points. However, this is problematic since the backward warp field is pose dependent and thus requires large amounts of data to learn. To address this, we introduce SNARF, which combines the advantages of linear blend skinning (LBS) for polygonal meshes with those of neural implicit surfaces by learning a forward deformation field without direct supervision. This deformation field is defined in canonical, pose-independent space, allowing for generalization to unseen poses. Learning the deformation field from posed meshes alone is challenging since the correspondences of deformed points are defined implicitly and may not be unique under changes of topology. We propose a forward skinning model that finds all canonical correspondences of any deformed point using iterative root finding. We derive analytical gradients via implicit differentiation, enabling end-to-end training from 3D meshes with bone transformations. Compared to state-of-the-art neural implicit representations, our approach generalizes better to unseen poses while preserving accuracy. We demonstrate our method in challenging scenarios on (clothed) 3D humans in diverse and unseen poses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Example of the model](https://preview.redd.it/uf1cx1o5gus61.png?width=923&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3a71d1f4bb4ba02b7146f421e5eed739fe422f7)\n\n**Authors:** Xu Chen, Yufeng Zheng, Michael J.

Though to be fair it\u2019s difficult for me to write about such abstract topics and keep things organized at the same time when I\u2019m still trying to wrap my head around them. I apologize if this is too all over the place, I will edit this post over time to fix or explain more things here and there.\n\nI am not presenting these as solid facts, but just things that *I* think are right. They should of course be proven through scientific experiments afterwards. I simply wanted to see if my ideas sounded logical to anyone else, a valid topic for the scientists to experiment on.\n\nThe word \u201cpattern\u201d will be used quite a lot in here, so I will define its definition before I start:\n\n* A set of information / agreements that surpass time, meant to affect or change something in a certain way. How something is meant to act like within the physical world.\n* This so-called pattern, deciding its next move as a pattern, is consciousness or is closely related to consciousness - as well as its reason for being a certain way.\n\nMy current understanding so far is that consciousness, or sentience if you will, is merely based on a set of complex chemicals that make up the neuron cells interacting with each other. To be more specific, these chemicals that make up neurons obviously follow the laws of physics so they should be able to let in and transmit outside information such as physical contact from outside our body and chemical contact between each individual neurons, in the way that should affect them on a fundamental level in which they are already bound to because both outside impulse and chemicals inside follow the laws of physics, as well as transfer its information in ways/that convey how those specific chemicals should react when impacted by a specific impulse according to the laws of physics.\n\nAdding on, the advancement of consciousness to sentience is caused by higher levels of interaction, e.g. interactions between interactions of chemicals have a more advanced consciousness than just simple chemical interactions. Same applies to neurons, because they are a good example of interactions of preexisting chemical interactions or higher.\n\nSince our neural network that seemingly stores consciousness is a network of a set of complex chemicals interacting with each other, it follows the laws of physics/chemistry. That is why our neurons are able to hold outside information and convert that impulse in languages that only chemicals and the set(interaction) of chemicals that make up cells understand, in which they need to in order to react a certain way(Another possibility is that the so-called languages ARE the process of the chemicals reacting in a certain way when presented an impulse/depending on which chemicals its near of). The process of the chemical interaction and furthermore a set of chemicals which one could technically call the process of the \"process-of-the-chemical-interaction\" interaction or \\[neuron\\] cells speaking that language, deciding how to speak it and understanding it depending on their level of interactions, is what I believe consciousness to be.\n\nTo put it short, the reason why chemicals have to react the way they do or why these reactions have to happen in different ways or the complex chemical reactions themselves also reacting with other of those reactions is consciousness. Complex network of chemicals deciding how to react back to its initial reaction according to their natural patterns of reaction. This is because consciousness is self-awareness and these are the requirements why reactions can happen a.k.a. be self-aware.\n\nNote: Because chemicals are fundamentally free to be themselves and act in specific ways according to laws of physics, it presumably gives us abilities to control ourselves as sentient beings.\n\nFew more things that we must question are how the chemicals within cells interact and form various structures within, what kinds of patterns do they make interact with each other and why, and how does that create and affect our consciousness in turn. I probably won't be able to answer all of them, but I'd just like to give it a go.\n\nIf the cells are the ones creating consciousness with their interaction instead of the chemicals that make them up interacting with each other which only creates individual cells and not consciousness, then we should also understand how cells interact with each other and how much do they resemble the chemical interactions and patterns. Thus we again question this: Do cells follow the same chemical principles like each of its aspects would or would it be like \u201cpatterns that consist of patterns of chemicals\u201d compared to mere patterns of chemicals, and so on?\n\nI personally think the principles wouldn\u2019t be the same, but the cells would certainly base themselves on them as they consist of higher levels of interaction. This is simply more chemical interactions, since chemicals interacting with the chemicals that are interacting and creating more complexity like the cells are still chemical interactions but taken further.\n\nSo cells are made out of various structures. They are chemical compounds bound in each unique ways. One theory that I had in mind would be the electric impulse from the action potential between our neurons sort of \u201cjustifies\u201d the chemical information being sent throughout cells, since the cells can be affected by both chemical and electric means. The electric impulse being very consistent through all forms of chemicals, would mainly empower the cell throughout, while the chemicals deal with its specific patterns.\n\nEach \"individual patterns of the cell interactions\" then makes a bigger pattern out of their interactions with themselves. That creates thoughts, feelings, ideas, anything our mind creates.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----",

Replacing natural abilities to understand with a man-made set of rules is not an optimal solution. One has to be free to think about things or be able to intuitively acknowledge many things in order to understand one thing, and we are limiting its capabilities by only making its thoughts just as free as the algorithms that someone truly free (a human being) comes up with, when we should be making it as free as this \u201cwhole\u201d person who makes the algorithms when he makes the algorithms, meaning that we should make the algorithms its \"actions\" and not \"where its actions are decided\u201d.\n\nAside from that, I was also wondering if we could create an electro-chemical based Artificial Intelligence, which would in my opinion be more effective than the approach we have today.\n\nIn order to make an artificial consciousness understand things like we do, we must make it so that its mind operates in a similar way as ours, as in, a chemical way. \n\nThis is because in order to strengthen the possibility and the relationship between a sentience and the environment(Laws of physics and thus chemistry) which it should understand in the same way we understand our environment, we need to strengthen accordingly the intimacy of the relationship between them. Make the bond between the two more direct and fundamental. The laws of chemistry are the fundamental truth of the Universe unlike the computer coded impulses that we artificially produce however we like them to be, so instead we make our artificial consciousness also operate in the same chemical manner. \n\nI personally think computer coded algorithms aren't the best medium out there for consciousness/or sentience, because they don't allow for direct interaction with the real environment. I think \\*true\\* consciousness should be able to base itself on the chemical patterns instead of computer codes which, really, makes it fundamentally more compatible with its environment.\n\nThis is because I believe life, or sentience if you will, is a some sort of symbiosis between the chemical interactions of molecules that make life up and the laws of physics that those said interactions follow. They should be intimately interconnected with each other in the same way when creating a man-made intelligence. \n\nThe optimal medium between these two aspects that nature gave us, are the patterns in which chemicals operate. Nature did not have to do anything herself to make life compatible with the outside reality therefore make them be able to think on their own; she just let them be. As long as we have a set of compatible neurons, we only have to let them be.",

        "1353": "Hey, what's up. I've finished a project that I've been working on for the last few months that I thought several others could benefit from, especially those that are fans of [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/) / [Prompt Toolkit](https://python-prompt-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/master/), and use Windows OS. \ud83d\udda5\ud83d\udcbb\n\n[https://github.com/xSlither/pretty-click-shell](https://github.com/xSlither/pretty-click-shell)\n\nPcshell provides several features that piggyback off of the Click Framework to make writing intuitive, versatile Shell applications as simple as writing a standard Click CLI. This includes:\n\n* Pretty Formatting of all Help &amp; Error text\n* Full Autocompletion for Click Groups, Commands, and Sub-Shells.\n* Automatic Lexing of your CLI\n* Support for Typed Tuple Literals as Option Parameters\n* Bult-in Shell Commands: repeat, clear screen, clear history, etc.\n* Command/Group Aliases\n* Suggestions for mistyped commands\n* Full support for Windows OS\n* Full customization of colors / features\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/mnfsvbah0ts61.gif\n\nThe project is obviously pretty young- would appreciate some feedback. But really, hope that it helps someone else out on their quest with developing shell apps, as it saves a lot of time and you can convert your existing click apps fairly quickly.\n\nThe ReadMe could use some work, but the example apps are pretty clear. I've also documented all of the key frontend components of the library.\n\nEssentially I wrote this project because I wanted a template for creating shell applications using Click's architecture, that had lots of snazzy features abstractly built-in for autocompletion, lexing, and other functions a shell app should have. Obviously, I made it to my liking- I wanted to use it specifically with Windows OS so it is likely more tailored towards that; I also wanted pretty formatting and colors for everything \ud83d\ude04\n\nThe core design is based off of extending upon Click for the optional feature of spinning up a cmdloop with Cmd &amp; using pyreadline to take input, and dispatching commands through Click. As I built upon the core of the module, I started adding the more advanced optional features like Autocompletion and Typed Tuples by implementing Prompt Toolkit features. When the shell is not invoked, your apps function as a CLI and objects that are returned from a click command are automatically routed to stdout (objects are serialized to json)\n\nI'm sure there are some core bugs I haven't taken care of. The project as is works great for my own use cases. Some of the logic is very complex- and a lot of it that is used across multiple components can be refactored into a core module, but I haven't gotten to that yet. The main cause of the complexity is due to the nature of overriding / extending on many pieces of the Click Framework, instead of creating something standalone and similar to Click; specifically the customized parsing is what makes things tricky. But, my goal was to create a template that could stripped down to a regular old click shell app.\n\nLastly, credit where credit is due; I was very inspired by clarkperkins' work on [click-shell](https://github.com/clarkperkins/click-shell). I really liked his method of leveraging Cmd to spin up the shell and built up my framework and learned a lot more from there on.",

Checking the next fixtures for a specific competition: [https://www.skysports.com/premier-league-fixtures](https://www.skysports.com/premier-league-fixtures)\n2. Checking the last results of each of the team and \u201cestimate\u201d their momentum (e.g. [https://www.skysports.com/football/wolverhampton-wanderers-vs-liverpool/stats/429116](https://www.skysports.com/football/wolverhampton-wanderers-vs-liverpool/stats/429116))\n\nThen, iterate these 2 steps for all the fixtures happening, from Premier League, Championship, League One, and League Two.\n\nSince I recently learned how to use Beautiful Soup to scrap data from web pages (see [GamestonkTerminal](https://dro-lopes.medium.com/gamestonk-terminal-the-next-best-thing-after-bloomberg-terminal-a263c001a61f)), I thought that I could create an automated task that would do all of these steps with a simple double click executable. After checking that I could extract such data from SkySports, I let him know that by the next day I would have something working.\n\nAfter dinner, I started working on the project, and before I went to sleep I had the first prototype working, which you can see in [here](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/momentum-football-bets).\n\nOn top of \u201chis\u201d automated task, I created a \u201cmomentum score\u201d which tries to estimate the momentum score based on what my girlfriend\u2019s father told me that he does. He looks into the last games of the team and see if they have a positive momentum by looking to see if they come from a winning series.\n\nSo, I thought it would be good to attribute a weight to each of the last matches where the most recent match would have the biggest weight, and last one from the 6 provided from SkySports stats would have the lowest weight. Together with this weight, I thought we could use the sum of the weight to the score in case of a win, subtract in case of loss, and don\u2019t do anything in case of a draw.\n\nSo, in simple terms, if score is positive the team is likely to have been winning their last matches, if score is negative the team is likely to have loss their last matches.\n\nBut then, I thought:\n\n\u201c*Ok, this is nice. But when you bet, you don\u2019t bet on a single team, but on the result between the 2 teams that are playing each other.*\u201d I.e. if team A has an amazing momentum, and so has team B, the bet will \u2014 in theory \u2014 be risky.\n\nHence, the next step was to address this concern. This was done by checking the momentum score difference between the teams, the bigger the momentum score, the less risky \u2014 in theory \u2014 a bet would be. What we want to see is a team that has been doing amazing for the past 6 games, and one that has been performing consistently bad.\n\nLastly, I added a confidence filter so that the terminal would only output the games that shown at least a certain X confidence. And also, an argument that would select the number of days in the future that we could look for fixtures.\n\nAfter having this implemented, the day after was about polishing the code, adding some colouring and emojis, creating a repository for it, a README, discussing the binning of the momentum score and bet confidence terms, creating a logo for it, and creating an executable + adding the logo which my girlfriend did.\n\nAfter this, we were quite excited to backtest the app. We filtered the next features with a big confidence bet score (to have less risk), and put 20 pounds on 3 different accumulators.

It's supposed to be a kind of free digital alternative to hardware like a Streamdeck utilizing your phone or a tablet to allow you to play sounds on your PC that can be heard in your stream.  \n\nIve used Hug as the server module, Playsounds to play the sounds, and some other small libraries that help with generating the required files. You can drag and drop mp3 files into the Sounds directory and automatically have the buttons generated when you reload the server.  \n\n  \n\nIve built everything in a way that doesnt really require you to know any Python in order to use the webapp, as most streamers do not program. However everything seems a little bit hacky because of it. If anyone has any pointers or criticism, it would be welcome!

I calculate the weight on the different planets by asking the user for their weight on earth. Since your weight on earth (in kilograms) is equal to your mass in KG. You can check this by doing your weight (in Newtons) = mass \\* 9.8 (gravitational acceleration of the earth). Where mass is the unknown variable. Once the user tells us his weight on the earth and the planet where he wants to calculate his weight, we use the same formula W = M \\* g. Where M (mass) is the weight in KG entered by the user and g the gravitational acceleration (in m \\* s \\^ 2) of the planet or moon indicated by the user. Where we calculate the unknown variable weight.\n\nHere you can download the [installer](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ox1tn5_V-07CTucXQZYyJk_d0WEVxNLU/view?usp=sharing) and here you can see the [source code](https://github.com/fpedaccio/Weight-Planet-Calculator).\n\nThank you for reading.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[GUI desing](https://preview.redd.it/bx2h0aebags61.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e854c4b4b4d8373188c2a54efa2a9245d057270)",

It's a tool that gives you access to \"debugger-like superpowers\" directly from your code, via convenient context managers.\n\nCurrently, NoPdb allows to:\n\n* **capture function calls**, including arguments, local variables, return values and stack traces\n* **set \"breakpoints\"** that trigger user-defined actions when hit, namely:\n   * **evaluate expressions** to retrieve their values later\n   * **execute arbitrary code**, including modifying local variables\n   * **enter an interactive debugger** like pdb\n\nExample usage:\n\n```python\n&gt;&gt;&gt; with nopdb.capture_call(f) as call:\n...     g(1)  # an example function that calls f()\n&gt;&gt;&gt; call\nCallCapture(name='f', args=OrderedDict(x=1, y=1), return_value=4)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; call.print_stack()\n  File \"&lt;stdin&gt;\", line 2, in &lt;module&gt;\n  File \"&lt;stdin&gt;\", line 2, in g\n  File \"&lt;stdin&gt;\", line 1, in f\n&gt;&gt;&gt; call.args['x']\n1\n&gt;&gt;&gt; call.return_value\n4\n&gt;&gt;&gt; call.locals\n{'y': 1, 'x': 1, 'z': 2}\n```\n\nI first came up with the idea when I was playing around with a deep learning model written by someone else and needed to retrieve and visualize some intermediate tensor which was buried deep inside the codebase, with no obvious way to get my hands on its value. [Here is a Jupyter/Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/cifkao/nopdb/blob/main/docs/pytorch_tutorial.ipynb) that shows how to do that. In general, NoPdb can be useful whenever you want to capture a variable/expression for later processing, or when you need to repeat the same debugging process many times \u2013 in both cases, this would be inconvenient to do in an interactive debugger like pdb. Moreover, NoPdb's breakpoints allow assigning new values to local variables, which pdb cannot do, as far as I know.\n\nI'm curious if people find this useful, and what other features would be nice to have.\n\n* Installation: `pip install nopdb`\n* Docs: https://nopdb.readthedocs.io/\n* GitHub: https://github.com/cifkao/nopdb",

        "1626": "It's all started back in the 2014... It was then that I got the idea to make the game of my dreams. But at that time I had no experience, so I had to start from scratch. Programming, animation, visuals - all this had to be mastered in free time from the main work, including weekends. After six months of \u201cintensive training\u201d, I realized that it was definitely not possible to carry out the idea alone. I began to browse thematic forums and look for like-minded people, along the way continuing to improve my own skill. \n\n*First concepts -* [*https://imgur.com/Rj6F9aP*](https://imgur.com/Rj6F9aP)\n\nAt first I tried to find the same enthusiasts as me, but disputes and disagreements began that only hurt the game (unexpectedly, huh?). \n\n***Lesson 1: Be prepared to make compromises or prepare for a quick loss of interest in the project of other developers if you defend your vision of the game, but you have nothing to pay.***\n\nSo it became necessary to turn to professionals, which means it was necessary to look for funding. I prepared documentation, concepts and started looking for an investor. I sent hundreds of letters to successful businessmen in social networks. And a group of wealthy young people became interested in the game. They were ready to finance the project, but made a condition that I must find a full-fledged development team. The negotiations took about two months. During this time, a programmer, animator and artist was found.   \n\n\nAnd then something happened.  Many would not be surprised, but for a beginner in the gaming industry it was a shock. They called me and said: \n\n&gt;\u201cWell, now you have a team, well done. And we consulted again and decided that we did not want to invest yet.\u201d \n\nI was very surprised, because all this time we communicated positively, and it seemed that they would agree... but life turned out to be cruel :)  \n\n\n***Lesson 2: When concluding any important agreements, always draw up official documentation that you can use if something happens. Even if you are \"in a very good relationship.\"***\n\nAs my try to get funding failed miserably, I loaned bank money to pay salaries and proceed with the development. I hoped that it will be way easier to find funding with at least some parts of the future game at hand. Unfortunately, there were not much to show anyone at early stage of the development. Unfortunately, there has been little progress at this stage. Some specialists did not always understand the technical tasks, which I set and did in their own way, so there were a lot of \u2018re-dos\u2019 and delays. \n\n*The first options for the appearance of the character   -*[*https://imgur.com/L8WbYH3*](https://imgur.com/L8WbYH3)\n\n***Lesson 3: learn to immediately set specific, understandable and detailed requirements for the task being performed. It's better to spend time explaining at the beginning than reworking later.***\n\nOn the other hand that was when the team realized \u2013 3D is a must. There are too many animations for every character and it\u2019s easier with the polygon modeling as you don\u2019t have to draw every single frame and it saves a lot of time with the pre-made animations.\n\n***Lesson 4: if you want more lively and detailed animations in your game, then think about 3D at the start, this greatly simplifies the process.***\n\nAlong the way, I kept looking a new investor. With the early pre-alfa version \u2018The Forging Destiny HROFT\u2019 we started a crowdfunding campaign at Boomstarter.\n\nThere were no big hopes about this platform, but the we wanted to test the crowdfunding mechanics anyway. All in all the project raised just about $250 out of the projected $15\u00a0000. There was a good thing though \u2013 the new investor expressed a desire to fund the project if they cut the budget. This was their only option so they had to agree to this term. With this funding we finished the first game build and designed a lot of 3D-models (most of which are still in the game).  \n\nAs time went by, the team ran out of money and we had to cease the development. No one believed at this point that they could ever release the title. All of my staff told me that if I want to do something right, I have to learn how to do it by myself. That to create a game of this level I have to master programming, animation and stuff. Obviously that wasn\u2019t the goal for just 3 or 4 years.  Not to mention other development tasks needed to be done. Sure, I could have started with something less complicated but this game was the only thing I could think about! I still didn't want to compromise xD\n\nMeanwhile the game\u2019s community was growing rapidly. The gamers saw that despite all odds I didn\u2019t give up and just kept working. Some of them (designer, animation designer and programmer) even joined the team without any pay! The gameplay as well as the most of the characters and the narrative had been revised and the game changed its name to **A.S.H. (About Savior Hunter)**.\n\n***Lesson 5: Even if it is very difficult, but you see that there is a chance - try and continue. Sometimes fate also brings positive surprises.***\n\nWhile pursuing my dream I made some desperate decisions \u2013 sold my car to pay for a motion capture studio to make character moves look as real as possible. First try was a failure, though. The studio didn\u2019t even considered the reference moves I provided them with, so I decided to take a train to Moscow (I live in Archangelsk, over 620 miles from there) get into the mocap suit and capture all the character moves he needed in the exact way he wants them to look like. \n\nIt had never happened to me before. As I was practicing the moves before the capture session I stretched my leg so hard that I barely could walk. They told me it could take up about 10 days to recover but my mocap session was in two days. I could not reschedule it everything was already arranged and paid. With some painkillers I had managed to get there and after the 5 hours of motion capture (and pain!) we somehow recorded all the moves I wanted.\n\n *After long hours of waving a stick -*  [*https://imgur.com/a1mGFYQ*](https://imgur.com/a1mGFYQ)\n\nAfter a while, we gave crowdfunding another chance and started a new campaign. Only this time - on Kickstarter. Lack of the marketing caused another failure despite the title raised more than a $1000 in pledges. It didn\u2019t help much though, and the team broke up again seeing their goals unachievable. Once again I had to find an investor to resume the development. And after a couple of months I found one. On a strict condition that I had to gather a new team and find a publisher first. Finding a publisher was quite a challenge and yet I somehow pulled it off. And yet It's all has been for nothing \u2013 after a week the investor informed me that they are not going to support my project.\n\nAt some point my family pushed me pretty hard to drop this project as I put way too much effort into it with little avail. Well, there was some progress in development, but it definitely wasn\u2019t enough. I started to realize that something pushes investors away so I had to find a common ground with them\u2026\n\n***Lesson 6: Do not forget about lesson 2 and if you see that people are not very interested in your game, stop and try to find out what exactly pushes gamers and investors away.***\n\nI continued to post information about the game on hundreds of sites in search of investors. Requests came from different countries, they say \"your game is very interesting to us\", but after a couple of weeks the investors disappeared. By this time I began to approach the issue of discussing investing much more seriously and after about couple of months of he negotiations the contract had been signed and development was on again. I could finally gather a team of professionals to develop a playable game build I would be proud of. With two new programmers, level-designer, animation designer and two part-time 3D-modelers. \n\nFor the next 2 months, intensive work was also carried out with the composer and sound engineer. Actually, all team members are contract workers implementing the game designer ideas for a salary. In so doing, they are did their best. Ludus Future team worked about 12-16 hours a day and sometimes willingly on weekends (everything, of course, was paid and no one was forced to work). I don't like the word \"studio\", as I find it too formal, and I still like to think that my team is more about friendship, despite the fact that all team members live in different regions of Russia.\n\nAfter six months of hard work, we got a new build called Demon Skin. I actively communicated with the team and listened to the opinions of other people, and as a result, the game's plot changed, as well as the main character. We sent Demon Skin to DevGAMM Online event and UEDC-2020. \n\n*The final look of the game -* [*https://imgur.com/dDDnOxM*](https://imgur.com/dDDnOxM)\n\nNow Demon Skin\u00a0is 3D platform game with RPG elements mainly focused on the melee combat. And I still finds its melee combat system the best one i know in this genre (inspired mostly by Severance: Blade of Darkness). I literally put my soul into the combat system xD\n\nIn short, there are three combat stances players should use in combat. By changing mouse directions you can target the head, torso and legs of the enemy. Switch stances timely to avoid attacks. With each new level you unlock spectacular and powerful combos. You should always pay attention to your stamina \u2013 if it is too low your attack gets way slower. \n\nInitially we intended the character to be fully powerless at the beginning just as it was in Severance: Blade of Darkness, but that wasn\u2019t met with the approval of our community. We have also designed a system of additional attacks to appear randomly during the combat. As the stance indication lights up blue \u2013 you can quickly select and perform this attack. It won\u2019t add you any damage, but it will buy you a few seconds to perform a super attack.  \n\n\n**RESULTS**\n\nAnd now, after almost 7 years of blood and sweat, life lessons and overcoming I finally finished my game and today it will be released on Steam ([https://store.steampowered.com/app/1522140/Demon\\_Skin/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1522140/Demon_Skin/)). I learned a lot, I managed to find investors at different stages of development, a team of professionals, and also bring the game to the point of \"finished product\". In just a few weeks, it will become clear which decisions during development were winning and which ones were not very good. I will learn new lessons and if it interests you, I will share them here :) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*P.S. Wish me luck and feel free to ask questions, the text came out a lot, so I did not go into small details. Today I will prepare for the release, but I promise to answer as soon as I have some free time.* ***Believe in yourself, never give up and you will achieve your goals!

So if a game had an average of 10,000 players on at any given time, and the average player played for 4.5 hours over 2 weeks, would you then extrapolate that 2 weeks is 336 hours, divided by the 4.5 hour average, times the average number of players on at any given time? From the example with 336 hours in 2 weeks\n\n10,000 (336 / 4.5) = 746,666.6\n\nso if the equation is right, I would think about 746,000 people played in the last 2 weeks. To say that if 10,000 people played for 4.5 hours, with 74.6 of those 4.5 hour chunks available then you would have available number of slots times the number of people occupying a slot at a given moment, even if their specific slots do not align with each other.

But the tire physics are so messed up it would basically require reprogramming the game to get them to realistic heating and contact patches. Same goes for accurate measurements of suspensions geometry. They got most of it but I'd really like to develop a sand box physics game based more on car physics as opposed to something like BeamNG more focused on destruction.",

        "1665": "Hello everyone, I am a hobbyist game developer and my real life profession is mechanical engineering. In the past, I have played and been inspired by naval games like **Pirates, Seadogs, Pirates of the Burning Sea, Black Flag** and **Naval Action** and at some point, I ambitiously decided to make my own ship combat game in Unity. And looking from a broad perspective, I actually quite liked the experience itself, while learning new stuff in coding, rendering, animating VFX and playing around with SFX.\n\nAfter some struggle and a steep learning phase, I finally end up having a basic prototype with a fundamental environment, ships and more importantly, a sailing model close to and depending on real-life physics. This is actually the point, where I think I have come across to a fork in a road.\n\nShould I go for a more realistic and simulation-like approach? Or should I focus into a more fast-paced and arcade-like game style?\n\nI think both of the styles have their own cons and pros. I subjectively would summarise arcade style as fun, fast and surreal, whereas, simulation is challenging, slow-paced and realistic. Besides that, I fully agree with below definition as well.\n\n*\u201cBoth can be challenging and fun, but arcade games tend to have an easier learning curve. It can be challenging, but allows either a casual gamer or a novice to jump in and be quick while a true simulation requires practice and has a steeper learning curve. A true sim is going be a game that you can\u2019t just jump in and go fast and win. An arcade game is a bit of a level playing field.\u201d*\n\nWe can name and focus on several different aspects of a game like the motion, the effects, interactions or the damage system. To have a more concrete and relevant example, we can examine the turning behaviour of a ship.\n\nIn an **arcade style game** mode, when the input for turning is there, the ship reacts to it immediately and begins its turning. Furthermore, the maximum turning rate is achieved immediately. So, when the right button is pressed, the ship begins turning right, let\u2019s say, with 2 degrees/second immediately. And when released, the turn rate is reset immediately to zero, thus finishing the turning maneuver. We can take the responsiveness of AC4: Black Flag as an example here.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, with a **simulation approach**, when the input for turning is there, the ship begins to turn slowly first. After that, the ship is gaining its maximum turn rate, while rotating faster over time. And when released, the ship continues to turn a little bit more with the effect of inertia until the drag stops the turn of the ship completely. Depending on your viewpoint you can define this motion as realistic or sluggish. The game Naval Action might be an example for that kind of motion. You can check the attached video for the visual implementation of this comparison in my prototype.\n\nWorking with all those definitions, I think going too bold for arcade or simulation style might be too much discriminating a player choice, thus losing the players favoring one of each styles. Of course, I like it, if I can get quick responsiveness of my inputs in a game, but I also like the realism of a simulation like game, where you should think and plan ahead your moves and actions like a chess game.\n\nInitially, my plan was actually somewhere in between. But, determining that sweet spot between arcade and simulation is the nontrivial part of this dilemma for me. To summarise, my questions regarding this topic are:\n\n* It is a fact that the fun and appeal of game-play depends on many things like core mechanics, graphics, SFX etc. I also know that it is mostly a subjective opinion, but in general, how can a game developer decide how much realism and how much arcade style are needed to ensure a fun and appealing game play for most players?\n* I for myself would categorise the game Naval Action as simulation-like, the AC: Black Flag as arcade and Pirates of the Burning Sea in between them. Black Flag is not an MMO like others and game mechanics differ a lot, but has the most sales among all of them. If we exclude Ubisoft and its huge marketing, does this mean that arcade style games are more favorable among the player base compared to more realistic and slow-paced games?\n\nAll of your subjective or objective feedback and comments would be much appreciated.\n\nFair winds!\n\n[Arcade vs Simulation](https://reddit.com/link/mpzk18/video/vj8fb1055xs61/player)",

        "1667": "Hello!\n\nMy name is SolarLune, and I'm an independent game developer, and like many of you, I am someone who has struggled heavily with the process of planning games. I've started probably 1000's of games over the past few decades, and finished 3 or 4. It's insanely hard to make games, and I feel like the hardest part is rarely the engine you use, but rather the planning process, and the follow-through.\n\nOver the past year and a half or so, I've been working on a tool *specifically designed* for helping developers to both *plan* and *stay on track* when it comes to developing games. It's also useful for individuals who simply need to maintain their motivation. It's called **MasterPlan**, and I've been steadily improving it with my community over time.\n\nHere's some images (linked, as I can't post images):\n\n[MasterPlan.](https://imgur.com/1BAgv6M)\n\n[MasterPlan with a different theme, shadow, and no outlines.](https://imgur.com/C9nAN6q)\n\n[The Map Task, which can handle creating maps for things like interiors, world maps, etc.](https://imgur.com/s4cGccz)\n\n[And here's the rest of the album so you can get a feel for it.](https://imgur.com/a/6KgOKrT)\n\nThe main reasons why one might prefer to use it is because:\n\n* It has features **specifically designed for indie devs**, like tasks / todo lists, images, gifs, sounds, a whiteboard for simple visual mockups, maps for designing interior shapes / layouts, and tables for completion of repetitive tasks (completing X animations for Y characters, for example).\n* It is **offline**, so you don't need to keep a web browser open, you don't need an account to use it, and your data is stored entirely on your machine, making it trivial to back it up and sync it to version control.\n* It is **simple**, made specifically for small teams or individuals. There's no extra stuff that most individuals don't need, like assigning tasks to people or people to roles, no overarching hierarchies or user creation, etc. It's just made for you and your plan.\n* It is **customize-able**. You don't have to have all of your plan in a single layout like some planning solutions - you can freely place items you want around your board in an effectively infinite space. This makes use of space to avoid pushing everything together in one mental space, and helps to make your plan work for **your** mind specifically. There are also a variety of settings to tweak how the plan is actually visualized (including support for theming), allowing you to make it look the way you want.\n* It also includes things to help you stay **motivated**, like deadlines and timers (which I personally find *extremely* helpful when it comes to keeping my motivation up).\n\nMasterPlan is currently available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. It's available to build for free over on my [Github repository](https://github.com/SolarLune/masterplan) (though prebuilt binaries are available over on Steam and itch, and it's on sale this week as well). If you do purchase it, it would help fund development; otherwise, please do feel free to build it, try it out, and see if it fits your needs.\n\nAnyway, that's it; I appreciate it if you read this far, and I'll get out of your hair now.",
        "1668": "Hey folks!\n\nYou may have seen me make threads such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/l165o1/lets_have_a_chat_about_the_dunningkruger_effect/), or [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/l4jlav/the_small_game_a_compilation/). Well today we are going to talk briefly about \"codeless games\". This isn't to bash the subject but to dispell some illusions about making games.\n\nThe general idea is sold as \"you don't need to know how to code to make games!\" which, if you are just on your own at least, is completely false. But what is it that people tend to try and sell you with this claim? The answer is usually Node Based Editors!\n\nIf you've never used a node based editor, the premise is rather simple; You are presented with a bunch of \"nodes\" that each represent some sort of block of code, which gets executed the same way every time it's used. Then you tie that node to other nodes in a daisy-chain like setup. The result is that you have a bunch of nodes that, when executed, will carry out some sort of game-related functionality. Some examples could be Blueprint from Unreal Engine 4, PlayCanvas in Unity or Bolt also in Unity (just to name a few. I think Game Maker also has some sort of node setup?).\n\nNow you might already see the problem here with the \"codeless game\". **Node based editors are code.** Quite a few engines that make use of them actually transpile the node chains you make into written code (like C++), then compile that instead. There are several ways to handle node based editors and they come in many forms. There are also other types of editors that are similar in nature, but doesn't use nodes to accomplish it. Same idea though.\n\nAs a side-note; If you've ever used a material or texture editor chances are you've used a node based editor to do it as those are quite popular in that space.\n\nWhy is this idea being pushed in the first place though? Because programming seems like this intimidating behemoth of a mountain that you have to climb before you can make games. Who wants that? You should just get to making your game already! No need to bother with all that technical stuff right? Well...not quite. Great things take time to make. Programming is a skill that a lot of people are more than capable of learning. But a lot of people are bad at teaching it online.\n\nClearly node based editors are a much more approachable way to look at code when you start out, or perhaps just if you don't want to learn how to write code. Perhaps a nicer introduction to it than writing the code with text. Node based editors are, to put it simply; An abstraction layer. They abstract away the difficulty of learning how to write code from scratch and streamlines the process so you can still makes games, without knowing how to write a piece of software. There are trade-offs of course.\n\nNode based editors tend to get quite unruly once you start making complex mechanics and game setups for example and there can also be quite the performance drain (on a per implementation basis). There are also certain systems and whatnot that are just not well-suited for node based editors. A lot of backend systems in a game (like save-file systems for example) would be much better off being written in code, rather than trying to make that work through nodes. Again, implementations differ of course, but it's just my own general experience talking there.\n\nThis is all to say that, node based editors are valid if you can make a game out of it. Why wouldn't they be? People who were schooled in making software, such as myself, might not really make much use of them because we prefer to write the code. But they serve a purpose for people who might need the programmatic freedom, but don't want to spend years studying for a bachelor's degree in the subject.\n\nWhat's important to take away from this post is that; Whenever someone tries to sell you the idea that you can make a game without code? Know that it is a completely false statement. Someone on your team *has* to know something about programming or how to code in order to make a game.\n\nThis idea that you can somehow make games without programming is one that needs to go away and instead we need to be honest about it. There is no such thing as a codeless game.\n\nBut making games now is more accessible than ever before because of tools like these.",

        "1679": "I have a self-made 2D game engine with a renderer that works well. I'm looking for advice on how to support up to 16 textures on the tiled world. I say up to 16 because this is what I learned (?) is Open GL's limit per shader. It sounds like it wouldn't be entirely unreasonable to simply stuff 16 samplers into a fragment shader and then just blend them all. The uniform list on the C++ side will look a bit ridiculous, but hey. Are there other, simpler methods I'm not thinking of?\n\nHere's a picture for reference, straight from the level editor:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/OVQgVNE](https://imgur.com/a/OVQgVNE)\n\nI was staring at the Starcraft 2 map editor the other day, trying to figure out how it might work. It looks like it uses auto tile, with several layers to allow for blending. But it doesn't seem to use layers at all, really. It seems to be layers sorted per-vertex depending on what texture you applied last.\n\nBack to my engine.\n\nThe map is represented by a grid of nodes. Each node has a tile type that represents one of the current three layers: \"void\", \"base\" and \"detail\". In the picture above, the water is \"void\", the dark mud is \"detail\" and the sandy yellow stuff is \"base\". (When picking a \"center\" tile, the tile atlas will sometimes serve up a random non-standard center tile, hence the grassy detail on the sand and some sand on the mud.)\n\nThe mesh generator is passed this grid and uses auto tile to determine what tile to draw for each node, resulting in a set of 3 UV coords for each grid node, one for each texture layer. If a particular node is a \"base\" node, it's base UV will be set and the other 2 UVs will be N/A'ed. \n\nThis is all fine and dandy but this level editor didn't exist 2 weeks ago and it's made me think 3 textures isn't enough. Before this, there was just a random level generator. I'm okay with 3 for the random gen because more textures complicates the algorithm. That leaves me with the problem of how to implement up to 16 textures. I can't figure out how Starcraft 2 does it. I think they may be using a subtile autotile renderer, but they still need to use multiple textures (hence the limit when selecting textures for the floor). That said, you can safely assume I really don't want to write a subtile autotile renderer. I have a tool that generates all the needed texture data from the standard set of 9+2.\n\nThe simple way to support more \"brushes\" for the level editor, like Starcraft 2, is just crank up the samplers in the fragment shader to 16, let the tile atlas editor specify which textures are \"base\", \"detail\" and \"void\" (for purposes of finding out what tile each node should be) and let the user sort it out when making a map as the mesh generator is run on the grid.\n\nHere's my fragment shader, there's not much to it:\n\n    #version 430 core\n    \n    layout(location = 6) in vec4 fragColor;\n    layout(location = 7) in vec2 fragUV1;\n    layout(location = 8) in vec2 fragUV2;\n    layout(location = 9) in vec2 fragUV3;\n    \n    layout(location = 1) uniform vec4 offset;\n    layout(location = 2) uniform sampler2D texLayer1;\n    layout(location = 3) uniform sampler2D texLayer2;\n    layout(location = 4) uniform sampler2D texLayer3;\n    \n    out vec4 diffuse;\n    \n    void main()\n    {\n        vec4 c1 = (fragUV1 == vec2(0.0) ? vec4(0.0) : texture(texLayer1, fragUV1));\n        vec4 c2 = (fragUV2 == vec2(0.0) ? vec4(0.0) : texture(texLayer2, fragUV2));\n        vec4 c3 = (fragUV3 == vec2(0.0) ? vec4(0.0) : texture(texLayer3, fragUV3));\n    \n        diffuse = (c3.a != 0 ? c3 : (c1.a != 0 ? c1 : c2)) * fragColor;\n    }\n\nIt *sounds* ridiculous to simply be adding 13 more samplers to this.

        "1681": "First think you need to consider is where your game can be seen. Here I will be talking about released games.\n\nSteam algorithm may surface your game mostly in these places:- Home Page More Like This (Because You Played)- Home Page Recommended For you- Home Page Recommendation Feed- Discovery Queue (if your game is old you will have hard time here)- More Like This on other game pages- Search Results- Tag Pages- A few other places\n\nIn most of these places Steam calculates how well your game fits there. This calculation is based on two parts:\n\n**1. The power of your game:**\n\n\\- How well it sells (it means how much $ it earns per thumbnail/capsule impression)- What is the median playtime (it's a bit more complicated than that, but it's based on the median play time)\n\nThe power is calculated per country. In search results the higher your power, the higher your game is. In other places power of your game is only part of the equation.\n\nTo increase the power, you should:- Create a good looking, fun game that will have good reviews and will look really great on screens. Also that will resonate with the Steam audience. So please do a research before you start making your game and check if there is any audience on Steam for your game. For example: If you create an NES-like retro platformer (like I currently do), remember that people who will play your game are most likely 30+, most younger gamers do not care about NES that much or at all. So if you will make your game around candies and little girls no one will play it. You should use some dark theme for your game, maybe a horror. I am doing this with my upcoming game Vampire vs Devil, you can check it on Steam, I published the page 2 days ago.- Find the optimal price (every game has it's optimal price that will increase your revenue per impression, you need to find it)- Find the best image assets (capsule, screens, trailers)- Find the best description- Localize the page of your game and the game itself. To at least a few\n\nTo find which price/image/trailer/description is the best, you need to use A/B testing. On Steam it's only possible to do the sequential A/B testing. So you keep one version for a week, then another version for another week and then you compare the CTR and Sales/Wishlist per impression stats. Be careful when you analyze the data using the info provided by Steam. Remember to not count the bots traffic and other kinds of traffic that is not related (for example if you are testing the capsule, do not count visits from external websites as they do not see your capsule). So it's a bit tricky on Steam to do this, but it's possible to some degree if you are careful.\n\nIf you want your game to have better reviews and you are still developing your game, read the negative and positive reviews (but especially negative ones) of games similar to yours and do not make the same mistakes.\n\n**2. Tags**\n\nIn most places I mentioned on top of this post, Steam not only use the power of your game but it also checks how well the tags fit to the place and the player. In recent times the power of your game is much more important than it was in the past, so the tags may not help you too much if your game has low power.\n\nThere are at least two tagging strategies you can use, depending on the place you want your game to be.\n\na) If you want to aim for the recommendation places (Recommended for you on top etc.), you should use tags that describe your game very well and that are used by as few games as possible.\n\n**In general the best tag is the one that:**\\- Describes your game as good as possible and is as concrete as possible- It's used by as few games as possible- The games that use the tag are popular and have many potential players that will be related to the tag. If the tag would be used by 1 very popular game, then it means that you have almost no competition but a lot of potential players related to this tag.\n\nb) The other possible strategy to use it to aim for the Home Page More Like This (Because You Played). If your game is somehow similar to other quite popular game, you can use the same tags as the other game and in exactly the same order.\n\nBut very important! Use only tags that describe your game to at least some degree. If the other game has tags that describes feature you don't have in your game, do not use that tag as this will be very badly seen by players and by the Steam itself.\n\nThe other important thing is that for this to work, the target game needs to first be similar to yours, and second needs to have as many tags as possible. If it will have only 10 or less tags rather than 20, it will be not enough to be shown on the Home Page of steam.\n\nRemember that half of the equation here is still the power of your game. Tags are only the second part of it. So even if you would have exactly the same 20 tags in exactly the same order, you may still not appear there in some countries, because your game is not good enough. But most likely you will appear if there are not many other good games similar to yours and to the targeted games.\n\nI would suggest to try both strategies in many possible configurations and see the results. But most of all you should focus on the power of your game as this is the most important factor on Steam.\n\n**What else can you do?**\n\n\\- Add good keywords in the Dev Panel. You may use google keyword planner to find them.- Remember that Steam also uses the Description field as the source of keywords. The description can be long, so having a good description full of good keywords may increase your visibility.- Answer to reviews.- Twitter - post there and use good hashtags. You can see how I approch Twitter, find: @ [Unusualsoft](https://twitter.com/Unusualsoft). Twitter is also very good to get feedback and to see if someone will like your game at all. Very valuable!- Open your wishlist page as soon as possible.\n\nIf you have any other advices, post them in the comments.",

Should I create a seperate shader and render pipeline for processing triangles as the first deals with quads?",
        "1687": "**TL;DR:** I am having trouble with all aspects of mesh generation for chunks, I would like a few pointers.\n\nI am developing a game similar to Minecraft and I have some trouble. My current system works, but not well. Basically here is my current system.\n* Worlds are broken down into cubes (chunks) each containing 16^3 blocks (voxels)\n\n* Chunks are stored in a C++ map, indexed by a 64 bit integer (first 26 bits for X, next 26 bits for Z, and last 12 bits for Y), meaning worlds are 2^26 by 2^26 by 2^12 chunks in size.\n\n* Geometry (meshes), which includes vertices, hue, and texture IDs for quads, are generated for any loaded chunks in range, and then are saved in a different map for meshes.\n\n* A mesh consists of a vertex buffer for quad vertices, and texture coordinates, and an 'instance' buffer for quad specific data such as overall hue and texture ID.\n\n* Meshes is generated by a for loop that, for each exposed face for each block in the chunk, 4 vertex data and 1 instance data are appended onto their respective buffers.\n\n* Exposed faces are determined by determining if neighbors are empty (no point generated geometry for faces that are not exposed).\n\n* Blocks at chunk borders require neighboring chunks to be accessed\n\n* This mesh data is (re)generated whenever a new chunk is generated/loaded or when a chunk is changed, and if the changed block is at a chunk border, the neighboring chunk(s) also have geometry recalculated.\n\n* Each frame, the geometry map is iterated, and a draw call is issued for each item.\n\n* Vertex shader is adapted to receive quad vertices rather than triangle vertices.\n\nThis system works for now, but I see several problems.\n* Chunk meshing could be done on the GPU, but I do not see how, because each block has an unpredictable amount of geometry. A buffer the computer shader would write to would have many gaps from blocks with no geometry to render. How should I go about writing a compute shader, where I pass voxel data in, and get geometry out? The size of the output geometry buffer will not be known before hand, and simply allocating the size that will accommodate a chunk with the largest number of exposed faces possible becomes a problem when I introduce complex blocks with complex models. Where should meshing take place? Should complex blocks be meshed separately? Also GPU meshing rules out basically all forms of greedy meshing.\n\n* Mesh for ENTIRE CHUNK must be regenerated even if a single block changes, because the mesh buffer consists of already processed geometry piled up in one buffer, so I cannot know what is what, making it highly impractical to merge new geometry into an existing buffer. Is there a different mesh management system that would permit a practical way to change meshes to reflect block changes without having to regenerate the entire mesh? One that would fit all my other requirements?\n\n* One draw call per chunk is required, bad news if there are a large number of chunks. This happens in a for loop in the draw method (called once per frame).\n\n* Quad vertices will always be whole numbers, so using floats is wasteful, plus, they are always going to be part of a chunks, so theoretically all I need to so is pass the block's location in the chunk and the chunk's location in world to the and let the GPU do all the adding but if you are cutting back that far basically brings you back to the start, voxel data?? AGH!! Plus doing this would eliminate complex blocks from the table so should I make a separate render pipeline and shaders for them too?\n\n* I cannot figure out a practical way to pass variable size arrays per vertex to the GPU, so this rules out passing multiple texture IDs at once for overlaying. How should I deal with textures that are overlain onto other textures?\n\nAll this dealing with chunks, multiple draw calls, meshing, what should be done on the CPU vs GPU, dilemmas, tradeoffs, having to accommodate a bunch of requirements such as support for more complex block models and having to cut back on memory usage, quads vs triangles, all this I have a headache. I have to choose a balance between practicality and accommodating a wider range of features. An easy to see solution would be to have multiple pipelines and shaders optimized for different tasks, such as one for normal blocks, one to handle complex block models, etc, but it ain't so simple. Doing so in of itself is impractical, requiring different buffers for these different block types, leading to more memory usage, more opportunity for error to strike, etc.\n\nCould I please have some guidance for the above concerns?",

        "1689": "A year ago today I began work on my first game and now I\u2019m looking down the barrel of my third game with a demo already available. While most people in this forum can probably share similar stories, I had no prior experience or skills in software development of any kind, my background being in marketing, and thus I thought my lessons might be of value to someone who was in my position a year ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Start Small**\n\nA month or so ago there was quite a bit of debate on this forum about how someone should start out in game development. I believe the majority of people came down on the side of starting small and for good reasons but I would like to throw my own voice into the crowd.\n\nPut your *must do* game idea in your back pocket and start on something you\u2019d *like to do* instead, because starting out you\u2019re going to make all of the mistakes. My first game has giant scripts that handle almost everything in scene and features only ONE array. This is the sort of technical debt that saps motivation and kills projects just as they\u2019re getting off the ground. \n\nSomeone with a technical background might not make these mistakes but you\u2019re better off making whatever mistakes you will make with small projects which you can limp to the finish line rather than on your magnum opus.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Finish your projects**\n\nUnfinished projects seem to be a common practice in the Game Development community which I think is a dire mistake.\n\nThe experience learned from finishing a project and the ability to be able to point at something you have made if you want to collaborate in the future is invaluable.\n\nIf you\u2019re knee deep in a project and still have a full bodies worth of work ahead of you think about scaling back, what can you do to get the project out the door in the next month? Not enough time? What about the next two, or three. I\u2019m not advocating for shovel ware but you\u2019ll learn so much about not only the design &amp; publishing process but also how great it feels to **BE** a Game Developer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kill your darlings**\n\nThis is a phrase attributed to Stephen King in the writing community and it gets thrown around a lot, I think it has equal merit in the Game Development community. \n\nIf you have an idea that just isn\u2019t working, no matter how much you love it, you need to kill it. Game development is tricky and time intensive. When you\u2019re starting a new project it\u2019s awesome coming up with ideas and mechanics which you think will play off each other but as soon as you start committing pen to paper some of these ideas just don\u2019t mesh. **Kill them.**\n\nAs a designer you should be obsessed with the core foundation of your game, mentally try to strip back the layers of a game until you have a minimum viable product, anything else is just glazing to this core. \n\nEarly in your Game Development career there may even be ideas that are worth putting in the game that you just aren\u2019t capable of yet. If your game can function without it and you just can\u2019t get your head around how to implement it in a satisfying way then kill it. If your core foundation is solid ground, then any half-implemented idea is only going to hurt the project in the end, you\u2019re better off with 3 great mechanics than 6 iffy mechanics.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Work with what you have**\n\nAs indies we occupy an unsure space in the market. Most marketplaces you\u2019ll be featured next to companies that have a larger lunch budget than your project budget. Trying to compete against these titans on their home turf is going to leave you frustrated. Instead, try to identify a niche you can service. \n\nI\u2019m personally a massive history buff and I have an inclination towards games that ask you to use your imagination more so than feeding the player fancy graphics and cool action. I want players to feel like they\u2019ve stepped back in time and to do that my games have mostly been \u2018event\u2019 based where players are given multiple choice solutions to randomly generated problems in a historical setting where they can play the role of a person in those times.\n\nWork with what you have, if you want to simulate a massive open world then do it, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to show it all. King of Dragon Pass was a major inspiration for me starting out and I\u2019m convinced that with enough skill you can create real, living worlds without a giant studio team.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Build an Audience**\n\nThis advice might not be so relevant for your first couple of games as they may just not be up to snuff but you\u2019ll want to start trying to build up an established fanbase as soon as possible that you can bring with you from title to title. I\u2019d really recommend setting up your social media, Reddit, Discord, Twitter, Facebook, anything you can think of, as soon as possible. Also, link to them on the menu page of your game, it makes it so much easier for players to contact you. \n\nThere are better write ups on here on marketing your game than I can get into in a paragraph but as an indie your best asset is approachability, you can directly communicate with your customers and implement their feedback, this is the sort of relationship a AAA company would go crazy for.\n\nYou should also try to get an intimate knowledge of your given platforms various quirks, for instance on Steam 10 reviews is your sweet spot, the more reviews the better of course, but if you can\u2019t hit your 10 reviews after your first month, you\u2019ll find yourself buried. \n\nSteam also does visibility rounds for major updates to games, which can help push you back into the spotlight. Preparing a fan feedback-based update for a couple of weeks post-launch is a great way to show your fans and potential customers that you care. You should also try and go on sale as often as possible; it doesn\u2019t have to be a huge sale but having that visibility for your wishlisters is awesome. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Just Start**\n\nMy only regret in game development is that I didn\u2019t start sooner. It may be tough to start but hell is it worth it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Thank you for reading**\n\nI hope this is helpful. In the interest of brevity in an already long post I left a couple of points out, I think they speak for themselves though:\n\n**Develop for yourself**\n\n**Collaborate when possible**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR;** I rewrote this a couple of times to try and make sure I was imparting as much pedestrian knowledge as I had to hand. If you\u2019re a grizzled developer, it might not be worth reading but if you\u2019re subscribed to /r/gamedev because you dream of one day making the things you play then stop reading and start doing.",

For example, if I want a boss to be enormous and take up 5x5 units, what are some ways to go about this?\n\nShould I change the pixels per unit on import of the asset, should I use Unity's scaling tool to resize it to where I want it, should I create the sprite to be large (say 256x256) and import it with 64 pixels per unit, or should I do something else entirely?

There's an implementation section at the end and I ended up using [this one](https://github.com/Silverwolf90/2d-visibility) in my own game. It works great, but there's one problem: overlapping rectangles.\n\nIt seems as if the original algorithm doesn't support them. On the [little things](https://www.redblobgames.com/making-of/little-things/#bad-input) section the author also mentions that \"the algorithm doesn't handle overlapping lines.\"\n\nIs this possible to fix? For performance reasons, my game has many overlapping rectangles. This allows the line of sight calculation to be much faster since it only has to compute line of sight against 14 rectangles instead of around 200. Allowing for rectangles to overlap greatly lowers the computational cost.\n\nUnfortunately, overlap results in extra triangles appearing. If you scroll down the article to the interactive visualization that lets you place your own blocks, you can see the error for yourself. Put a small box on top of a large box, barely overlapping, like so:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/1Oxhwy0.png\n\nAs you can see (the error is circled in red), there's an extra visibility triangle shown on the opposite side. Interestingly, if you move the small box to the bottom of the large box, there is no error.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/vRWpa1B.png (the error doesn't occur when the small box is under the large box, only when it is on top of it)\n\nSomeone in the comments mentioned that this is possibly occurring due to the sorting, but they don't mention any potential fix.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea on how this could be solved?

Spaceslingers was made in GMS and was my first commercial game (but it was by no means my first game, I've been a casual hobbyist on and off for nearly 15 years now).\n\nHere's a small portion of the article:\n\n* Twitter isn\u2019t great for marketing, but it\u2019s ok at gauging interest in stuff. Reddit is pretty good for marketing, but there are some strict rules you need to follow about self-promotion which can hinder your advertising efforts. Don\u2019t do facebook, it\u2019s kinda useless.\n* In the same vein, twitter actively suppresses tweets with links to external websites, so don\u2019t use it to sell your game. Treat twitter like a gamedev conference, to find industry people who might be able to amplify your voice, not general games. A subreddit, a discord channel, or a mailing list (or better yet all three) is where you want to be trying to drive interested people.\n* Make a short, snappy, sweet game that you can pump out quickly for your first release. Don\u2019t make a bad game,  but make a good game that isn\u2019t super-complex to make. Make it quick and price it accordingly, use it to learn how to navigate the steam ecosystem.\n* Marketing starts from before you even decide what project you should seriously commit to. Prototype heavily and post stuff on twitter to see what the interactions are like. Now is the time to use your fellow gamedevs for feedback on ideas. Once you find a  prototype that seems to shine to other people, do some market research on the genre/hook. Use that to decide if it\u2019s worth pursuing or not.\n\nRead the rest here: [Recounting A Successful Failure (The Spaceslingers Post-Mortem)](https://refreshertowel.games/2021/04/13/recounting-a-successful-failure-the-spaceslingers-post-mortem/)\n\nIf you like how I write you can follow me on twitter: [@refreshertowel](https://twitter.com/RefresherTowel)",

I'm designing the universe for Planetary Drift that you can explore after finishing the main campaign. Planetary Drift is a top-down racing adventure game set in space at the heat death of the universe. I don't want to procedurally generate much, and your goal is to get as much of the world's currency as possible. The focus is the racing, so I think I'll build it like this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlayers can generate new race tracks, which are then added to everyone's shared game world as a new star. New stars are added to the universe at increasing distances from the center of the star system, and elements are generated around them. There's a data link station, which lets you view leaderboards and the locations of new stars, a ship hangar, where you can repair your ship and download new engine specs (there are currently 77 different downloadable stat sets with unique names), a planet under attack by a the game's enemy drones, and a wormhole that spits you out one-way at the coordinate opposite your current one.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think I'll implement trade, where you can buy things at the planets under attack and deliver them to other planets under attack, and they'll deal in 4 different goods with prices depending on their quadrant (+,+ / +,- / -,- / -,+ on a 2d grid). Of course, you have to get through the enemies to sell and buy from a planet, which involves an asteroids-like combat system.\n\n \n\nThe main focus will be the racing, which gets you the most light. I'm looking for whether or not there's anything else you'd like implemented on the galactic scale? This will be an infinite space, mind you.",

        "1720": "Hi All\n\nI recently got admitted to a game design program I applied to, while I was applying I genuinely thought getting a game design degree is not a bad idea, and to be honest I did not think that I can actually get admitted, I just took a shot. But in after spending time reading all the negative reviews on the value of game design degrees, I became very hesitant, so now even if I got in, I'm not really excited. I think my questions about game design degrees can be summarized to 3 main points, and I hope someone can please help me out with some of these.\n\n1. How bad is the job market for game design majors?\n\nI am not a US citizen but I'm looking to get a job in the US with my degree, and since this game design program is classified as a STEM program (which give me extra lottery opportunities to get a visa), I thought it could help me getting a job here, but since many posts that I reviewed claim that many Americans can't even get a job with their game design degrees, I can only assume worse for the internationals. How bad is the market and will getting a game design master's actually help me jobwise?\n\n\n2. Do companies specifically hire people with game design degrees to write stories?\n\nI stated at the beginning that I initially did not think that I can get admitted, mostly because I have absolutely ZERO experience in programming and only took one very basic game design course during my undergrad career. I actually want to develop story arcs and write scripts for game instead of focus on programming, and I thought about getting a MFA in creative writing or screenwriting, but IMO, a international student getting a writing degree(or any other non-STEM degree) in the US basically means that he/she will have very slim chance of getting a job here, so I applied for this STEM game design program instead. So does American employers actually hire game design graduates to write stories specifically?\n\n\n3. How do I become a game designer/writer with a irrelevant degree?\n\nIf I decided not to get a game design master's, and instead getting a masters degree in irrelevant fields, what are the chances that I can still get hired by employers in the game industry? I realized that portfolios and networking are important, but how can I develop my portfolios and networking while studying and working with people in a completely different field like sociology?\n\n\nThank you guys so much for reading these, as you can probably see it in the post, though graduating from college soon, I'm still confused with my future career paths, which ultimately led to these many questions, please bear with my ramblings and I really appreciate your help!",

Money isn't an issue because my employer pays for it.\n\nI will probably also use that laptop for private gamedev projects and I was thinking about going for a Mac since most of our developers are on Mac OS at work and I like the OS and I'm too much of a \"I just want it to work\" guy to deal with Linux on my work laptop. I had some trouble with Linux on my thinkpad and just installed Windows after 2 days of tinkering with it.\n\nBut I don't like Windows. I'm past the stage where I pick favorites. I just don't see the point in beating my Windows installation into a Unix-ish system using WSL2 and Docker. Like, ignoring the tools I've installed, my personal directories look like I'm using this machine as a social media / shopping device. All my stuff lives in the WSL Linux directories but even then I still have some problems with the system.\n\nAnyway, I used to do some gamedev on my Linux machine and even though it's not as nice as on Windows, it works. Now I was wondering how the experience compared to Mac OS.\n\nOpenGL is deprecated but the current drivers are implemented on top of Metal. Does anybody know if there's a chance for this to just go away? I like OpenGL and I'm not sure if I'll ever get used to Vulkan enough for OpenGL to become irrelevant for me. I couldn't find anything regarding this except that same studios are mad that Apple is deprecating OpenGL and apparently some studios stopped supporting Mac OS because of that.\n\nTalking about Vulkan: The Vulkan subreddit was divided when I asked about this a while ago. How is MoltenVK? Does it work well enough to be used? How has your experience been on a Mac? As far as I know it's just Vulkan implemented on Metal.\n\nAnd how is Metal? Do you like working with that API? With a Mac I could of course also do something for iOS The license is expensive but not too expensive. I'm not doing very graphics intensive stuff anyway so why not target iOS too. \n\nAnd last but not least, how has your experience been with engines? I'm mostly interested in Godot and maybe Unity. They look like the best fit for me but I have used neither.\n\nI do like working without an engine though. I'm probably more interested in the technical challenge of writing engines than writing games.\n\nAnd of course please feel free to share your experience regarding anything else. Tools availability, optimization of the Engine editors, whatever. \n\nEven if I get a Mac for work, I might still get a private notebook and then I'm free to choose.\n\nThanks for you time.",

        "1725": "Okay so I had a sticky thread up for about 3 weeks/1 month now asking people community feedback on this sub and it's rules. What you guys thought of it, liked about this sub, thought needed improvement and what needs changing\n\nHad some decent comments, interesting points. In large it seemed like everything likes this sub and what it is, just need to tighten a few things\n\n1.) Strengthen the enforcement of the 'No Promotional Activities' rule. Basically if you're just trying to peddle a service, especially paid, your post will be removed and depending on your history, potentially banned. This is if you're advertising your services as a designer - there's subs for that, your etsy or anything else. People do not want to see that here, there's other subs for it.\n\n2.) Remove the flair 'No Feedback Please'. It seems like everyone is in agreement that this rule is pointless, used by people precious about their work, dont want to hear ways they can improve, and used for lazy posting as well. It inhibits conversation, posts are locked, you cant even ask how OP did it. We want to open conversations, open feedback, allow people to ask how it was done, what can be improved. So this flair is being removed. Feedback will always be encouraged.\n\n3.) Currently we have the rule '**If posting work for feedback, it must have a comment for context.**' We're changing this to go across ALL posts that you are sharing your own work.  Just like in the Graphic Design sub, if you're posting your own work, you MUST include a comment giving that work context. It can just be simple, the brief and what you were tasked to do (even if it was a self motivated project, what were you trying to achieve? What's the point of your work?) Think about target audience, the purpose, functionality, the problem you were faced with, how you tackled it, what you did, the research, what you wanted to do, how do you feel about the result. This gives people a greater understanding of your work, we can appreciate it better, have more insight into your work and your process, ask better questions and also give better feedback. Win all around, win here and win there, win over there too. \n\n4.) Stricter enforcement on the rule '**If posting someone else's work, credit them appropriately.'** For this we kinda need the communities help. Mods cant be everywhere all the time, we also cant be fountains of all knowledge and all design work that's ever been done. Sometimes we too get fooled by someone presenting work as their own when it's not, and the haven't credited the original designer. If you see this happen, please report. ALL WE ASK FOR IS A MENTION. Just credit the original designer, where you found it, you don't need to link anyone anywhere, just mention, oh yeah (so and so) inspired me on this piece. I followed the tutorial of X, I wanted to achieve an X vibe for this piece. It is important that in the creative industry, you credit inspiration and original designers and do not pass off things as your own pieces\n\n**Last but this is probably the most important.**\n\n**Defining what attributes as 'Design' and is appropriate to post in this sub.**\n\nThe Definition people seem to agree on is 'Functional purpose'  -  design solves a purpose, it has determined functionality - woodwork, furniture, chairs, craftwork. mechanical design, architecture. This definition subtly differentiates between more 'art' posts which can be described as having 'defined purpose' art and expression is more subjective, you can just do a painting with emotion and not want it to solve anything. Art in the traditional sense of digital, you can also design a building for example (architecture) but with no determined functionality or problem it's solving.\n\nThis is a hard one for people to get their heads around, especially people that maybe aren't as experienced as others. But there has to be a cut off point for this sub somewhere. In the same way you can look into graphic design and view peoples portfolios that's loads of nice work, but it's got no functionality, you can design a pretty website, but it's not UI optimised, they haven't thought about the customer, the journey, the UI, the site map, the navigation, the site structure, the functionality or purpose, it's just a nice thing they thought was cool. So we're trying to give posts and artwork a purpose, functionality as a separator of what can be posted here.\n\nHonestly - if this rule was already imposed it wouldn't affect all that much that's already posted  - just weed out the lazy posts of 'here's a thing I did - it's got no functionality or reason but isn't it pretty' There's tons of subs dedicated for each niche, graphic design, woodwork, art, painting, digital art etc we want this sub to be inclusive of everything, but still has to be a line between just a 'creative artwork' sub and a 'design' sub\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope you all agree and like these sub changes. Honestly I dont think they are much of a huge difference, but will just tighten up the sub a bit more",

        "1821": "So I'm looking for a name, or short description of a style of design that seems to be somewhat articulated but I'm not sure of what to call.\n\nThe style/aesthetic of design emphasizes placing the function on display and tends to celebrate or incorporate flaws or eccentricities in the design medium, rather than eliminating or hiding them. Function is never hidden. \n\nThis style is somewhat exemplified in:\n\n* Film: Fantastic Mr. Fox; where Wes Anderson intentionally used real animal fur because it [displayed the effects of handling the puppets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ba3c9KEuQ4A)\n\n* Web design: [Motherfuckingwebsite](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) and [Craigslist](https://denver.craigslist.org/) for their almost brutalist take on web design exposes the underlying structure of the web more clearly. [The dithering in the low-tech magazine images](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/09/how-to-build-a-lowtech-website.html) that is used to lower server costs. \n\n* Painting &amp; sculpting: The incorporation of physical imperfections in artistic media into the work (knot or burl in wood carvings/carpentry, cracks/weaknesses in stone sculptures, scars in skin for tattoos, etc.) .\n\n* Interior design: Farmhouse/apron sinks where the front of the sink is exposed, rather than hidden behind a faux drawer (same for something like open cabinets, exposed piping, etc.). \n\n* Repair: Kintsugi repair where repair of an object is highlighted, rather than hidden. \n\n* Music: Improvisations/compositions that might be made / take advantage of a broken string on a guitar or a dented trumpet. Cage's 4\u203233\u2033 comes to mind here, but lacks the structure of the other examples. A better example might be the [Wintergatan marble machine composition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvUU8joBb1Q) that embraces the randomness of marbles and at the end devolves completely. \n\n* Architecture: Something like Passive house that takes into account the local terrain, position of the sun, direction of the wind, etc. to determine how a building should be built.\n\n* Fashion/accessories: Something like a bespoke suit or a pair of Iron Ranger boots, eyedropper fountain pens, simple (non-click) ballpoint pens. \n\nWhat I'm talking about blends aspects of minimalism, brutalism, and Bauhaus. None of these fit exactly. From the Wikipedia page on it, the closest I think I've found is [Wabi-sabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi), but I think that the description of Wabi-sabi promoting transience doesn't fit - this aesthetic/style would focus more on the permanence of \"fingerprints\" and making things last. For instance, I think Wabi-sabi might celebrate the Wintergatan composition due to the fact that the machine broke at the end and thus is 1 of a kind, where this aesthetic would emphasize the obviousness/brutalism of observing the marbles in action. \n\nDoes anyone know what this might be called?",

I've got a machine I got from China and a new vacuum pump. When I first turned the machine on. It worked fine. Then I clicked to turn the vacuum pump on and everything seem fine. After 20 seconds there was a thick white/clear cloud over the motor/fan. I switched the machine off. It was hot to touch on the top if the grill which I think is the motor. You could keep your hand there but it was hot.\n\nI let it cool down and came back  3hours later. I then tried it again as I noticed the oil was low, so I drained the old and filled with the new. The motor part that and the smoke smelt of oil and days later still does. When I tried to switch the vacuum pump on for the 2nd time, it tripped the breaker. Now every time it keeps tripping the breaker. \n\nI asked the supplier who said that apparently the 3 phase motor will only take 415v but in my unit where its been installed I'm.getting 424v. He said this is too high. A d that is causing the switch to trip. \n\nSo now he says to buy a step down to bring it down to safe level of 400v. \n\nWhat do you all think.. is it tripping now because its too much power. But than why would it have started before and not now.. surely it should have tripped then too. Is the motor damaged? \n\nI've asked an electrician and they say it'll take 1k to fit a step down. I wanted to what everyone who knows about vacuum pumps think. I mean it's brand new. But I could waste money on a step down because the supplier is just trying to pass issues to random solutions.

        "1917": "Looking into this company called \"Wigl\" and they seem to be making some bold claims about their ability to wirelessly transmit power at an \"unlimited distance\". \n\nFrom my understanding, beamforming power in this manner is lossy even when positioned directly in front of the transmitter and the main issue being the directionality and accuracy of the power.  \n\nHonestly, either they are too vague or I am not smart enough to grasp what they are trying to do.  They say how they differ from other people transmitting in this manner:  They are connecting wireless power transmitters. So think of not just one transmitter that can only send power in one room (10ft),...but a paradigm shift to tens, thousands, or millions of those same transmitters (only much smaller)...meshed networked together to create a seamless ultra-wide area network = limitless distance.\n\nThey say they have the patent for the above process. \n\nAre they saying they basically plan on making something that transmits millions of small beams of power throughout a room then it connects to your phone through millions of small recievers?

        "1924": "This is a bit of a backstory, but when I was in highschool I had a waterbed.  The edges of the bed had a frame and the top of that was very cushy.  I tried sleeping many ways, but the most comfortable was to lay between the frame wall and the rounded edge of the waterbed cushion like a pocket. So when I slept, I did not sleep on my back or either of my shoulders.  I slipped myself in between the warm plastic water bag rounded edge and the paneling.  Then I put my right arm and right leg on the frame.  Immediately within weeks, I remarked, \"Mom, I need 2 hours of sleep less, and I feel way more refreshed from this bed, and I don't know why.\"\n\nMath of Sleep:\nAfter I moved out, I was not as comfortable sleeping, but college was tough so it was just one of the many challenges of that time, so I took it like a trooper.  After I graduated for self declared Scientific Computing from Carnegie Mellon with a minor in physics, I got to thinking back to my water bed.  I did the math.  When my arm and leg are supported by a frame, that weight is no longer pushing down on my body.  When my body is suspended by the rounded edge of the water bag and side paneling of the frame, not all of my pressure was laid on a single point.  I would reason that the weight I had pressing down was less than 1/3 of a normal bed.  I concluded, \"That is why I had such a good sleep,  I had a more even distribution of weight.\"  \n\n----\nSounds good on paper, now what? Not many people like waterbeds these days.  Well I got to thinking that it is just two core components, a railing around the edge of the bed with a cushy top, and a \"sleep chamber\" pocket so your weight goes down around the edges and such instead of smaller areas of your back and shoulders in a conventional bed.\n\nEngineering the railing was very very easy. I cleaned off a long 2x4, put it at the proper height of my bed.  The first night I was ill and could not put pressure on my one side.  The next night I was able to try it though, and lo and behold, when I woke up, I didn't have pain in my shoulder or back like I had for the past few months(I put some weight on during covid).   Not only that, I also felt more refreshed and needed less sleep.  \n\n\nThe full arm is about 5.7% of a human male's mass.\nThe full leg is about 16.7% of a human male's mass.\n\nArm+Leg = 22.4% of a human male's mass.\n\n\n\nOf course not all weight gets suspended some fall on torso still, so say 17% of your weight is no longer pushing down on your shoulder.  As a 220lb male, that is 37lb off my shoulder, and it gives a better sleep.   17% * 220 = 37lb off my body.\n\nIt is important not to raise the bar up too high, otherwise, you'll not only be supporting your arm and leg, but also the rest of your body as you \"hang\" from it.   This just winds up stressing your shoulder too hard and counteracts the benefit of a Soft Bed Frame.  So position it properly so it is high enough up, yet not so high that you stress your shoulder and hips.  I find the height I use is around 4-6\".\n\nConclusion:\nSo we know that if you're the type to sleep on your side, try making a cushy bed frame so you can lay your one arm and leg up on it.  It is very easy if you have wood and soft things laying around and takes less than an hour which you regain that very night needing less sleep due to less stress on the downward weight on your body.\n\nNext up is the Sleep Chamber.  I'm sandbagging designing this because it will be more work and I'm not exactly sure what design I'm using.  I bought a small tarp at a hardware store to prototype, and will lay a blanket in it, but the variables are tough to think about without long trial and error.   \n\nSleep Chamber Variables: Does it attach right to the edge of the mattress? Does it attach to the top, middle, or bottom?  What shape is an optimal U?  I'm also not a skilled craftsman so assembling it will end up ugly, and I'm not sure what materials to use to the right side to connect the tarp's others side of the U.\n\n\nI envision a functional mass produced product would be adjustable height in two segments for legs/arms.  I reason you could push the frame outward and set in place by pins for example, and this would open up the optional sleep chamber pocket.   It could be really easy to manufacture and sell.  If everyone needed 2 hours less sleep as I did, 2 hours * minimum wage job of 10$ an  hour * 365 days = 7000$/yr earned.   Paying 300-700$ for a King/Queen/Twin Soft Bed Frame and Sleep Chamber would be a steal.  It isn't just less time needed to sleep, it is also more refreshing and you feel less wake up pains from pressure of weight if you're a big guy.\n\nI figured I'd share that with you guys.  I have found tremendous success making a prototype for myself with just the Soft Bed Frame already.  I know the Sleep Chamber will help, but I'm in no rush to make it.  Have a great day, and maybe in the future, we'll all be sleeping with 66% less downward pressure on our back or shoulders.",

This is a beat - a pulse - a cycle - a regularly recurring event. It's a timing event for a system. The second is defined based on hyperfine splitting, etc. The physical world is governed by such accurate timing events. This led me to what I consider to be a significant understanding.\n\nWhen it comes to decentralsied and distributed systems such as blockchain platforms, these accurate timing systems don't exist from what I can tell and there's no way to measure time with significant accuracy.\n\nIt also seems to me that blockchains themselves could function as such timing systems with blocks playing the role of beats. For example, the goal for the bitcoin blockchain is to create a new block every 10 minutes. You could say that the blockchain has a pulse of 1 beat per 600 seconds on average. This kind of simulates a heartbeat - a timing system with a variable beat. It can speed up and slow down and \"resting\" will return it to normal. What these distributed systems need is a blockchain equivalent to a fixed rate timing system like hyperfine splitting as opposed to a variable one.\n\nSo, what I'm hoping to achieve with this post is to hopefully start a discussion about this subject. Is it possible to create a blockchain type system with incentives but with a fixed rate block creation?\n\nIs such a system even necessary or could creating blocks more quickly have the same effects, for example, 1000 blocks per second instead of 1 block per 600 seconds?

I'm sure there are hundreds or other examples I am not thinking of right now.\n\nI would be interested in hearing other example of this pattern that people like, but I am most interested in help finding research that delves into the mathematics behind this pattern. I am hoping to find answers to questions like \"What properties of this mapping are necessary/sufficient to guarantee a faithful mapping?\" and anything else that could help me understand, and perhaps generalize, this pattern. I don't even know the right way to describe this when trying to find prior work, so even the right thing to search for could help. Thanks in advance for any help!",

I'm not saying this as any sort of legal coverage, or to not get somehow sued if any of you screw up, this is genuinely how it should be. The idea here is **information security.** I'll say it again. **information security.** The whole point is to make the world a better place. **This isn't for your reckless amusement and shot at recognition with your friends.** **This is for the betterment of human civilisation. Use your knowledge to solve real-world issues.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's no singular all-determining path to 'hacking', as it comes from knowledge from all areas that eventually coalesce into a general intuition. Although this is true, there are still two common rapid learning paths to 'hacking'. I'll try not to use too many technical terms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first is the simple, effortless and result-instant path. This involves watching youtube videos with green and black thumbnails with an occasional anonymous mask on top teaching you how to download well-known tools used by thousands daily - or in other words the 'Kali Linux Copy Pasterino Skidder'. You might do something slightly amusing and gain bit of recognition and self-esteem from your friends. Your hacks will be 'real', but anybody that knows anything would dislike you as they all know all you ever did was use a few premade tools. The communities for this sort of shallow result-oriented field include [r/HowToHack](https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToHack) ~~and probably r/hacking as of now~~.\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\nThe second option, however, is much more intensive, rewarding, and mentally demanding. It is also much more fun, if you find the right people to do it with. It involves learning everything from memory interaction with machine code to high level networking - all while you're trying to break into something. This is where Capture the Flag, or 'CTF' hacking comes into play, where you compete with other individuals/teams with the goal of exploiting a service for a string of text (the flag), which is then submitted for a set amount of points. It is essentially competitive hacking. Through CTF you learn literally everything there is about the digital world, in a rather intense but exciting way. Almost all the creators/finders of major exploits have dabbled in CTF in some way/form, and almost all of them have helped solve real-world issues. However, it does take a lot of work though, as CTF becomes much more difficult as you progress through harder challenges. Some require mathematics to break encryption, and others require you to think like no one has before. If you are able to do well in a CTF competition, there is no doubt that you should be able to find exploits and create tools for yourself with relative ease. The CTF community is filled with smart people who can't give two shits about elitist mask wearing twitter hackers, instead they are genuine nerds that love screwing with machines. There's too much to explain, so I will post a few links below where you can begin your journey.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRemember - this stuff is not easy if you don't know much, so google everything, question everything, and sooner or later you'll be down the rabbit hole far enough to be enjoying yourself. CTF is real life and online, you will meet people, make new friends, and potentially find your future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is CTF?

I'm aware VPN's are an existing solution, but I'd rather use an alternative solution, **if one exists**. \n\nIs there anyway I can encrypt the data being sent/disguise it so when it goes through the network, it'll seem casual.

I know a bit of hacking and a bit of Java.\n\nTo give some information about the structure: There is a JavaApplicationStub that gets everything started and a folder full of jars that I assume it uses in the process. I haven't done any analysis on the JavaApplicationStub, only on the .jar files contained in the folder.\n\nWhat I've tried so far:  \n1) I first snooped around the decompiled .jar code and added some lines to log the info I'm looking for -&gt;  .jar are signed through some external signer, so the recompiled code didn't run because the hash didn't check out. I don't think I'm ready yet to power on my quantum computer and crack the RSA it is signed with.\n\n2) Running Java snoop and intercepting a function call -&gt; Can't run it on my computer bc it's outdated, and I doubt it works with newer java\n\n3) After snooping around even more, found some \"Java serialization data, version 5\" files that hold the information I'm looking for. -&gt; Since it's serialized, the raw file looks like gibberish, haven't tried deserializing it, but I'm sure there is some security measure as well. \n\n4) Mitmproxy -&gt; All info is transferred through HTTPS, but it somehow detects that I'm using a proxy and doesn't connect\n\nIdeas on how to proceed but seem tedious: Explore the JavaApplicationStub and maybe turn off the jarsigner? Explore the source code and figure out how it detects my proxy and possibly find a way around it?\n\nIf someone could point me in the right direction, refer me to resources or even be so kind to help me it be very appreciated.\n\nLastly, why does hacking Java seem dead, is it that secure or that easy or am I just dumb and approaching it the wrong way?",

I was pretty salty because these devices are hard to find, and I couldn't even test it to verify I hadn't been bamboozled with regard to the mobile operating bands (B2, B4 vs B1, B3) of the device.\n\nI've never really been too interested in hacking, but it's my dongle, and I want it now. After doing a brief search on how \"hacking\" is done, I realized that most WPA2 AP attacks require you to intercept a handshake occurring between the AP and a client. There are no clients in this case, so I found this article ([https://miloserdov.org/?p=2100](https://miloserdov.org/?p=2100)) concerning hacking an AP without clients, but the author mentions that this is specifically for 802.11i/p/q/r protocol routers with \"roaming\". According to the cardboard box, my dubious dongle is not one of those (802.11b/g/n).\n\nI'm wondering what attack vector I should chose to crack my client-less dongle. I did use a scanner thing to confirm that it is using WPA2 PSK authentication, and it seems logical that I should try to crack it with a \"rainbow table\" or a \"dictionary attack\".

The End User devices that have Pulse Secure components already installed would need to follow one of the two methods outlined below:\n    Run the attached BAT Script (UninstallPSALAndPSC.bat).\n    Note - This would need End-users to have admin privileges.\n    Manually remove PSAL and Setup Client components,\n                a.

Select \u201cPulse Secure Setup Client\u201d\n                e. Right Click and Uninstall.\n    \n           3.  Once, Step # 2 is completed, the End-Users should be able to successfully connect to the new PCS version.\n    \n    Frequently Asked Questions :\n    \n    1.    Can we use the same Pulse component uninstall script for all the affected versions?\n    a.    Yes, we can use the same Pulse component uninstall script for all the affected versions.\n    \n    2.    Will the script impact Pulse Installer service?\n    a.    No, the script will not impact Pulse Installer service.\n    \n    3.    Does this script work on all Windows Operating systems?\n    a.    The script works on Windows 10 (64-Bit).\n    \n    4.    Do we have to upgrade the PCS server only after end-users clean up the pulse components?\n    a.    Both the activities can run independent of each other.\n    \n    Workaround:\n    Use Pulse Desktop Client (Do not launch it through the browser).",

The main panel is above our server room, and the second is a fiber connection a few hundred feet away. We have older switches, maybe 9-10 years old. For over 10 years, the network has been totally fine with our badge panels, and their sub 10ms response requirements to allow access to the building. Two weeks ago, they started pinging over 10, sometimes hitting over 100ms, which prevents the door codes/badge swipes from unlocking the doors. Now, I'm seeing a steady fluctuation between 1 - 20ms., and an occasional 100+ms. I have swapped the cables, ports, switches, turned off traffic inspection on the firewall, confirmed no running back ups at time of spikes, had the door access NIC replaced in the panel, changed the power supply, and had back up batteries swapped. Changed the static IPs, confirmed they're not in DHCP scope to reserve, and changed the gateway on the readers. Confirmed the port used for transmission (3001) is okay, too.  If I pull the power on one of the panels, the ping will stay at 1ms for about an hour, then steadily increase. I am at my wits end on this.

The problem with TUN mode is some newer controllers now have RSTP with the benefit that brings in daisy chains and redundant loops and we want to take full advantage of that. \n\nRSTP Ring 1; We would like to be able to hang a loop off of a VPN device directly but research suggests the Edgerouter itself doesn't support RSTP loop blocking, thus the addition of Edgeswitches. No big deal and this doesn't require OpenVPN TAP. \n\nRSTP Ring 2; We would also like to have the possibility of going from location to location in a ring network. This would look like more of a daisy chain starting in one Edgeswitch and ending in another Edgeswitch, with the TAP OpenVPN network between the two ends completing the ring and the Edgeswitches handling RSTP blocking for the ring. In theory this would add redundancy in a missing Edgerouter, or if the Ring itself was broken somewhere each half could still be accessed.\n\nSomething I'm not sure about is in the server itself in TAP mode, can the OpenVPN network have no connection to the customers LAN like it can in TUN mode if you don't add the \"route\" directive to do that?",

My understanding of network concepts is decent, however I am not a network engineer by any standards, so I would genuinely value some help.\n\nThe situation right now:\n\n* Equipment\n    * MikroTik Router CCR2004-1G-12S+2XS * 2 (one at each site)\n    * NETGEAR XS728T * 3 (10GB 24 Port Switch)\n    * NETGEAR M4300-96X (40GB Switch)\n\n* Office 1\n    * 10.0.0.0/16\n    * Desktops: 10.0.2.x\n    * Servers: 10.0.5.x\n    * Wifi: 10.0.3.x\n\n* Office 2\n    * 10.1.0.0/16\n    * Desktops: 10.1.2.x\n    * Servers: 10.1.5.x\n    * Wifi: 10.1.3.x\n\nThe two offices are linked via IPIP L3 tunnel so that 10.0.x.x can reach 10.1.x.x (and vice versa)\n\n**However**, we are planning to change ISPs shortly which will give us 2 external IPs at each site. One static, which I'd like to reserve for servers behind NAT, and the other dynamic which I'd like to allocate to desktops &amp; wifi clients behind NAT. Desktops should be able to reach important ports on the server network, e.g. ssh, smb, etc, however otherwise be locked out. Additionally, I'd like to segregate wifi traffic so that users connected to the wifi network can only reach the outside world and are prevented from accessing any internal resources. I'd like this design to be applied at both sites.\n\nThe switches we have (Netgear) appear to support VLANs, which I imagine is probably the solution to this, however I can't say I have much previous experience in setting something like this up. I think the subnetting could be better designed as well, rather than have each type of machine exist in the same /16 subnet. \n\nAny tips/advice/suggested changes would definitely be welcome!",

        "2309": "TL;DR: I have received the order to investigate how to get roughly 300 IoT devices connected to our network but they have a rather limited WiFi support and I'm trying wrap my head around possibilities on how to get them integrated. The vendor often mentioned MAC address whitelisting...\n\nMost of their current customers seem to give them a separate WPA-PSK SSID, I'm not that keen on adding PSK to the mix and no SSID currently has PSK enabled. Also can't simply add another SSID since I'm already at the limit of 4 announced SSIDs our APs can support. The IoT vendor doesn't have any existing customers with WPA-EAP, they would be interested in EAP support but are lacking experience in that area.\n\nI'm trying to understand if we could even remotely think about adding support for these devices onto our main WPA2-EAP SSID for plain MAC authentication bypass. It does sound counterintuitive to me though. I've never encountered this combination and so far, it looks weird to do both (either devices get whitelisted based on their MAC or they do PEAP-MSCHAPv2 / EAP-TLS, so I'm uncertain if that is even a remote possibility. Technically FreeRADIUS on its end can do both at the same time, that's not that uncommon on wired networks - but on wireless? \n\nThough their micro controllers used (an Arduino core) should have had support for EAP-TLS for some years already  based on some research... but they failed to import our client certificates we've given them so far and I'm trying to look for alternatives.",
        "2310": "I've applied for a gigabit fibre internet connection from my ISP. They've finished installing it and have provided the IP details, I have a /30 which is to be used for my router and then they've provided a /29 for me to route myself (i.e. in a different range and not part of their gateway).\n\nI'm trying to split this block between 2 routers/firewalls. Previously on other sites I've put a switch on the end of the ISP device and plugged my routers in and assigned one of the /29 on one device and one of the /29 on the other device. However I can't do that here as it's the /30 which has the \"next hop\" address for the ISP router. \n\nIs my only option to put my own router on the /30 and then split the /29 into 2 /30s for the next hop for my own routers? This feels really wasteful. \n\nI've asked the ISP if they can provide a /29 instead of a /30 + /29 but they're adamant that this is \"how we do it now\".",

They are on coax (I know, I know, upgrading to fiber scheduled in about 90 days) at 150/20. There are no other ISP options in the area except AT&amp;T DSL at 3/1. No thanks.\n\nAbout every 12 hours or so, but not *exactly* every 12 hours, the site internet connection will drop. Monitoring data from the firewalls show that the Comcast modem/all-in-one thing stops responding to pings on its gateway address. Firewall has public IP on its WAN interface so no double-NAT going on.\n\nThe Comcast modem's US/DS and ONLINE lights would go out and begin flashing in the past, indicating an upstream problem. Power cycling the modem would fix the problem for another day or so. Now, it's doing something different wherein the US/DS lights stay lit suggesting that it's maintaining upstream connection but it won't pass any data. Nor can the firewall ping it on its gateway IP address.\n\nThere are a couple switches between the firewall and the Comcast gateway due to stupid demarc decisions that are beyond my control. The switches are connect the firewall to the gateway (on a dedicated VLAN) by a combination of 10GBASE-LR SMF and 10GBASE-SR. Other traffic across those same links on other VLANs is working fine with no reported or observed issues.\n\nWe insisted on a modem replacement which Comcast took a month (yes a literal month) to arrange. They finally did so yesterday and, after they did so, we had smooth sailing for nearly 24 glorious hours. Then this morning, the connection died again. Rebooting the gateway did not fix the issue this time. We had to reboot it, wait for it to come all the way up, and THEN unplug the CAT6 cable from the switch and plug it into a different port. Only then did the gateway begin passing traffic. We've done this with 3 different ports on 2 different switches so I really doubt the switches are at fault.\n\n\nAt this point my customer is beyond frustrated. Comcast is insisting that their new modem is fine and there's no problem, even though the firewall reports wild swings in response time and packet loss pinging the gateway at random times during the day and then hard-down outages about once a day or so.\n\nWhat I'd like for this problem, and others, is a device that I can plug in at certain points of a customer's site to be remotely accessible and to pull diagnostic data from. I'm thinking a NUC or something like that that can run network monitoring software (Like EMCO Ping Monitor maybe) and possibly has cellular capability so I can see what's happening *during* an outage.

        "2325": "I am working on a project that requires me to spin up a virtual lab, simulating the live environment, test changes there and then, once the changes are verified in lab - apply them to the live environment. \n\nOne of the big hurdles I ran into - virtual labs (at least Cisco ones) do not allow you to ssh into virtual devices by default, which makes it nearly impossible to use network automation tools like Ansible. Of course, you could extend the virtual network into the real one, but at least in my environment it would create lots of other issues with security and other teams.\n\nMy solution to the problem - write a proxy server in python, which will receive SSH connection from Ansible and proxy them to the virtual device. I have written some very basic script a couple of years ago and used it for some small testing, then somebody else turned the script into a linux service and just recently I added some code to handle CMLv2 lab (where there are no telnet ports exposed anymore, instead you have to SSH into the CML host and type \"open virtual\\_device\\_id\" to open console connection to it).\n\nYou can find code with install instructions here - [https://github.com/eoprede/ssh\\_to\\_telnet\\_proxy](https://github.com/eoprede/ssh_to_telnet_proxy)\n\nAs an example, here's how I start script in my environment: \n\n    /usr/local/bin/ssh_to_telnet_proxy -k /root/.ssh/id_rsa -p 3000 --cml my.cmlv2.com --logfile /var/log/ssh2telnet.log\n\nAnd this is how my ansible inventory looks like, when I am connecting to one of the virtual IOS devices:\n\n    test:\n      hosts:\n        \"ssh2telnet.proxy.com\":\n      vars:\n        ansible_connection: network_cli\n        ansible_network_os: ios\n        ansible_user: gesha24@/ecf1dd/n1/0\n        ansible_password: password\n        ansible_port: 3000\n        ansible_become: yes\n        ansible_become_method: enable\n\nAfter that I can run pretty much any playbook against a virtual device and verify it performs as expected.\n\nHopefully somebody will find this useful. Reach out here or on git if you have issues/bugs with the code, pull requests are also always welcome.",
        "2326": "Hi all:\n\nSorry if this is the wrong subreddit for this, but it's a bit of a niche question! I am also unsophisticated in this area, so I apologize as well if I use incorrect nomenclature.\n\nI need to have a number (100 or so) of \"ethernet\"/patch cables tested to confirm their compliance with  their stated Cat6 specifications. Rather than on-site, I'd prefer to be to send them off to a lab somewhere that can do this  testing at their site and provide a report on which cables pass/fail to meet Cat6.\n\nI've found individuals who can do this sort of testing \"informally\", but I'm really hoping there's something more formal out there. Any recommendations?\n\nThank you in advance.",
        "2327": "I'm having a strange routing problem within a AWS VPC that I just can't get my head around.\n\n    VPC: 10.16.20.128/25\n    Subnet: 10.16.20.128/25\n    Routing table: 0.0.0.0 to Internet gateway, 10.16.20.128/25 local \n    Network ACL: standard (rule 100 allow all, rule * deny all)\n\nI have 2 linux/debian instances. The first one is [10.16.20.132](https://10.16.20.132) is also has a VPN connection to an external VPN server for the subnet [10.16.0.0/16](https://10.16.0.0/16) (so a superset of the local network). It also has net.ipv4.ip\\_forward=1 enabled in /etc/sysctl, which is required for routing.\n\nBoth instances can connect to the internet and are able to ping each other. The first instance is able to ping hosts at the other side of the VPN and it's confirmed that the VPN server has a route back to the subnet. In both cases, tcpdump shows all the packets as I would expect them.\n\nWhen I add a route to the [10.16.0.0/32](https://10.16.0.0/32) subnet on the second host and route it via the first host, I can't ping hosts at the other side of the VPN. The part where I can't get my head around is that I can't even see the packages arrive at the first host using tcpdump. I can see the packets leave host 2, but they never arrive at host 1.\n\n**Host 1 config**\n\n    # sysctl -p\n    net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1\n    \n    # ip add\n    ...\n    2: eth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt;

To some extend it\u00b4s understandable that a company needs to keep moving and not paying debt is not a short term problem. So the problem was, how could I find debt in an automated way? This extension analyses which methods of your codebase are used in every request in the production environment and let you know of those which aren\u00b4t used in a nice colourful way.\n\nThe way the extension works is by tracking all the methods used on real requests. Let say you have an endpoint that is never hit by customers, the extension will tell you(for example): you have UserController::create, User::create, etc methods which has not been used in the last X months. With that information, you could focus your debt on removing code that has not been used in the last 6 months. That\u00b4s is just an example, the extension will give you the information and from there you could use it as you want.\n\nWhat\u00b4s the difference between this and code coverage? This is not a replacement for code coverage. Code coverage is awesome but it helps you understand which percentage of your code is cover by a test. However, it does not tell you if the target code is used in production or not.\n\nThe extension helps development teams to remove that code that isn\u00b4t adding any value and instead it\u00b4s making harder any refactor where that non-used-code has dependencies. One clear example where I\u00b4d loved to have this tool sooner is when doing a PHP version upgrade or a framework update.\n\nAs I said this extension is meant to be used in production. In production is where real traffic happens and therefore, conclusions made there are accurate. In terms of performance, it adds a minimum impact (&lt;1%)\n\nAnyway, I\u00b4d love to have your feedback on the extension/purpose as well as having some early adopters who are interested in start using the tool for free(it\u00b4s ready to be used).

The main difference is that it does not extend \\\\DateTime or \\\\DateTimeImmutable, but instead it provides own fully immutable DateTime replacement. Why? There are few reasons but the most important one is to provide better and safer, Object Oriented API to work with DateTime/Date/Time/TimeZone/TimeUnit and TimePeriods. Safer means that the whole library API is designed to expose commonly misunderstood concepts and make them explicit, like for example adding month to given date expects to precisely define number of days DateTime::add(TimeUnit::days(30)); as a TimeUnit instance or use relative time unit DateTime::add(RelativeTimeUnit::month());   \nCalendar is the core library and it comes with few extra things like support for LeapSeconds, different Time Epoch  (TAI, GPS), TimePeriods (iterating, overlapping, merging, finding gaps, sorting etc) or precise time measurement.   \nThere are few more libraries built on top of calendar, like for example Business Hours, Holidays (which is just an abstraction and bridge for other libraries), Rate Limiter, Retry but they all waits for the the calendar to be stabilized. You can find them here [https://github.com/aeon-php](https://github.com/aeon-php) \n\nWe are looking for feedback, negative feedback is also more than welcome so if you have your reasons to even not consider using this kind of library, please let us know why so maybe we can make it better.   \nIf you would like to join aeon project, doors are open!

        "2537": "Greetings Reddit,\n\nYou might know me as the person who wanted to get rid of the PHP Short tags, rename the `::` token to `T_DOUBLE_COLON`, or the person you'll mostly likely curse if you ever hit a newly introduced `ValueError`. I've been working on php-src for about 2 years now, and the PHP docs for about 3. As such I have voting rights on PHP RFCs.\n\nAs you might be aware the [Fibers](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/fibers) RFC is currently undergoing a vote to be included in PHP core. I should preface this that I'm not an expert *at all* in asynchronous programming, I never used Swoole, nor AMP, nor ReactPHP, and my usage of Node.JS has been rather limited, however I try to make informed decisions and thus did some reading and talked to the RFC author for clarifications. I'll also mention there are reasons for voting against this such as adding maintenance burden for the project, this can live as an extension, doesn't provide enough building blocks, etc. Moreover, not everyone (actually the majority) of No voters are not associated with the Swoole project, at least to my knowledge.\n\nHowever, the Swoole people have been the most vocal about this addition, as such being a project in this space, and experts at it, I tried understanding their reasoning. From what I can see they are pushing the Node.JS way of doing asynchronous programming, which suffers from the \"[What colour is your function?](https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/)\" problem. Which is a key article to read as to why Fibers (also called green-threads or co-routines) are a superior model.\n\nFrom replies to the official PHP internal list the feedback/concern by Swoole members has been the followings. \\[summarized in my own words\\] A philosophical one with the [Fiber class should not be final](https://externals.io/message/113419#113428), [various concerns about the C implementation of it](https://externals.io/message/113419#113428) (concerning but this is mostly about the integration with the new internal Observer API, and the lack of a C API for adding co-routines, something which can be amended whenever this proposal is accepted), and an allegedly incompatibility with Swoole. This last point is extremely concerning but seems also pulled out of thin air, as both [Swoole](https://github.com/swoole/swoole-src/tree/838f674c5ef870222401078c108dff402db56f6c/thirdparty/boost/asm) and [ext-fiber](https://github.com/amphp/ext-fiber/tree/master/boost/asm) (upon which this proposal is based of) use the [Boost assembly files](https://github.com/boostorg/context/tree/develop/src/asm) for fibers, therefore I would imagine that when a C API is added, this would become a non issue, but this remains a valid reason to vote against it as in its current state it doesn't provide one.\n\nThe other main angle which is brought up by the Swoole team is that this addition doesn't make PHP magically asynchronous, which to me misses the point of this proposal. But they do [provide 7 components needed for PHP to be asynchronous](https://externals.io/message/113419#113491), namely:\n\n* An EventLoop API\n* Fiber/Coroutine/GreenThread (which this RFC is about)\n* IO-Scheduler (Socket/FileSystem/ChildProcess/Signal/Timer/Stdout/Stdin)\n* CPU-Scheduler\n* Compatible with existing extensions\n* Service container (how to support php-fpm and/or provide a co-routine version of an HTTP server)\n* Co-routine communication,\u00a0How to pass messages between two co-routines\n\nSome of these components can be made in user-land (namely the event loop, the I/O scheduler, even an HTTP server could be made in PHP), I don't know if it possible to do in user-land the last point about co-routine communication which might be possible by using generators and sending values to it which it can yield via the [Generator::send()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/generator.send.php) method.\n\nFrom the RFC we can see that this proposal plays nicely with various extensions and profilers (XDebug even works straight out of the box), the only other incompatibility I can think of is, once again, missing a C API for fibers.\n\nThe CPU scheduler component for sure cannot be done in user-land, but I also have trouble understanding why it is needed, as from my understanding the whole point of fibers is to not rely on OS threads, which can be used by using the [parallel extension](https://github.com/krakjoe/parallel).\n\nAlbeit the discussion is progressing slowly, it is understandable due to the language barrier and time zone difference, as most of the maintainers are Chinese from my understanding. However, what I do take issue is that crucial information is being communicated *outside* the list ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/doubaokun/status/1369620921842024463)/[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/m43c03/what_swoole_is_swoole_community/)) in a what can be considered a smear campaign due to the nature of these posts. What makes this especially egregious in my opinion is that it stems from an individual who has a vote in the PHP RFC process, and apparently [isn't subscribed to the list](https://twitter.com/doubaokun/status/1370745765774163970).\n\nI will note that I'll always defend someone for not giving their reasons against an RFC, it is totally in their right to do so, but if you are going to anyway while providing context, it should be done on the list so that everyone involved can make an informed decision, something which might have led more people voting against it.\n\nIn the end where does this leave us? From my understanding Swoole's value is based upon the tool-set and APIs built *on top of* fibers, not fibers themselves. I could understand the resistance about this proposal if it was fundamentally incompatible with Swoole, but as said earlier it isn't. Therefore, there is only one conclusion that I can arrive at: for Swoole maintainers, the introduction of fibers, which allows other projects like AMP, ReactPHP, Symfony, Guzzle, Psalm, etc. to utilize them for improvements, would drastically reduce the value they provide (being one of the only ones to have such a native system at this time) to a point of irrelevance.\n\nSomething which seems very strange to me as they have an multi-year head start on asynchronous and non-blocking APIs.\n\nSo I wonder, do Swoole maintainers lack confidence in their own product?",

        "2557": "Hi all,\n\nLike many others, I was always interested in VR but didn't really get my act in gear until Half-Life Alyx was announced. At that time it became really hard to get headsets, so I broke one of my own rules and bought a new Rift S from somebody selling it for more than the $400 it was worth. I had considered an Index at that time but ruled it out for multiple reasons: I wasn't sure if I would like VR, I didn't like the idea of setting up base stations in my small apartment, and the money was a lot for a first headset.\n\nA year later and I've really been enjoying my Rift S a ton. Half-Life Alyx was fun, but I've also played a lot of Until You Fall, Moss, Superhot VR, and others. I've also moved an have a lot more space to play VR than I did a year ago. For these reasons I'm considering upgrading to an Index, as I know I'll like it and it's supposedly a big jump in quality from a Rift S to an Index. There's also the fact that I really don't want to have to log in with Facebook to use my Rift S in the future (luckily I started my Oculus account prior to them implementing that rule, but still, by 2023 it'll affect me).\n\nSo I wanted some opinions. I'm fortunate enough that I can still afford an Index, so that's not a concern. I have seen some other models that look good like the G2, but I heard that the tracking is not that good and I like to play games with more motion so I feel like that will be a problem for me. It's possible that Valve may announce a new HMD, but that's not a guarantee so I feel like if I just make the jump and not worry about newer models it might be worth it. If they were to announce a new HMD right after I bought it I would only be a bit bothered if they dropped the price of the Index, but otherwise I'd still be happy.\n\nFor reference, here are my computer specs:\n\n* i7-9700K\n* Nvidia 2070 Super\n* 16 GB RAM\n\nThanks everyone!",

She has gone into depression recently and I\u2019m worried about the strong meds that the doctors prescribe for her. I warn her against using them daily or too much and she assures me that she mostly takes them when she really cannot handle the pain anymore. I\u2019m home sick after a horrible sinus infection from which I suffered significant pain so I picked up a Nat Geo from my unread pile that looked at pain research \u2014 causes, recent advances in understanding and managing it, and research on new and better medical approaches than just addictive pain meds. \n\nOne of the more accessible remedies they mentioned and that I would like to experiment with for my mom was VR. The research shows that VR can help take patients\u2019 minds off pain due to the immersive experience which distracts the brain from the constant pain signals it sends for people with chronic pain. They specifically cited underwater VR experiences. \n\nI\u2019m technologically behind and I have no idea what we would need to set her up with basic VR equipment. The extent of her use would be nice and soothing landscapes and settings, so no gaming or anything fancy. \n\nGrateful for info on what I need and approximate costs. Do I need to buy a computer? There is a an old and slow (no memory) laptop in her home but she is not skilled at using it. What would be the easiest and most cost-effective equipment?\n\nAlso welcome any additional information on the application of VR for pain, if anyone has read more. \nThank you!",

I've been interested in VR/AR for a while now. Got to demo the Vive and oculus for the first time back in 2016 and it blew my mind. Now I am doing some research regarding the market for VR as an arcade/group type event. I just discovered this sub and thought it would be a great place to gather some data for my project! \n\nIt would be awesome if I could receive your input,  the survey is 21 questions and should take less than 5 min. \n\n[https://csulb.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_bDAQGJNMxYYcY86](https://csulb.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bDAQGJNMxYYcY86)",
        "2575": "***(STEAM GAME)*** \n\nAlright... let's get one thing straight. Blaston, if you've never heard of it, is a 1v1 duel kind of game. It has a sort of Neon/Night Club looking aesthetic to it. I believe that this game has incredible potential, as it's extremely physical, extremely fun, and has a lot of potential to grow and evolve. This game will leave you feeling like Neo from the matrix dodging the bullets in slow motion. I will also mention, that this game will have you sweating bullets in a matter of minutes (provided you're trying). I've already sunk 150 hours or so into the game, and I have no intentions of stopping.\n\nNot only is it just fun for competitive players such as myself, but it also has a dedicated \"lounge\" area for people who just want to either chill and talk with fellow blasters, or duel them by fist-bumping them. Let me just say as well, that the graphics look amazing. Actually, the moment I logged in, the first thing I mentioned to myself was how good the game looked. The guns are fun to use but have a high skill ceiling (especially the \"ellipse\" weapons which have the ability to curve, similar to the movie \"Wanted\") There are many diverse weapons to choose from, such as a giant shield that is placed, a shield you hold, a type of sniper, SMG, all coming at you in a slow-mo kind of motion but is fast.\n\nLet me also say, no matter how good you think you are, there's almost no guarantee you're the best. People are constantly coming up with new strategies and load-outs to beat their opponents to a pulp with.\n\nHowever, there's one main thing that I want to mention... The price. DAMN this game is worth the price. It's often going on sale for $7 or less (normally $10). One of the main things I look for in a game is the price (obviously), but when I watched the trailer, it looked like a solid $20 game, no joke. Turns out it was only $10. I'm huge on getting games that cost what I think they're worth. So to see this game was only $10 was insane. Since then, I've been playing almost non-stop since January 11'th.\n\nSome warnings: You do need a LOT of room to play this game to its fullest. I highly recommend playing with a Quest 2 in a large area (possibly with gym mats under your feet), I believe it's a 6x6 platform, which not even I have (considering I use Rift S and can't move backward much since my bed is there). Even with this limitation, I still climb to the top 20 in the world consistently when I play for a full season. I highly recommend getting some sort of protection (this could be knee-pads or anything of the sort), however, I highly recommend playing with something on your feet if you have stuff nearby, as it hurts REALLY bad when you kick your heels on the back of your bed frame as I do.\n\nI also highly recommend not playing competitive (the default mode) for too long, as I often get a bit burnt out after a while, so I go to the Ozo Lounge (located to the right of you in the main menu, just click the door) to chill and hang-out as well as do some friendly duels with some friends.\n\nIf you want any tips, or if you just want some general help with the game, there are a few things I recommend. First off, check out [WudiPlays](https://www.youtube.com/user/WudiPlays) on youtube, as he makes amazing Blaston content, and streams quite often, and he's a top player, so you can ask him just about anything in terms of what weapon load-outs are good, etc. [u/wudiplays](https://www.reddit.com/u/wudiplays/), he also has some Reddit content talking about Blaston, and if you're interested, you can join the Blaston Subreddit - [r/Blaston](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blaston/)\n\nYou can also join the [Blaston Discord](https://discord.gg/N6jrcgQZAs), which is full of welcoming people who will help you with just about anything. You can also request a free copy of the game for another friend as long as you're master rank in-game. (I'm not sure if it's guaranteed to give you a copy) You can also join [WudiPlay's Discord](https://discord.gg/nDT6EupKA6) itself (where people will also help you with whatever you need). You can join some competitive discords where people will host tournaments to see who's the best for money rewards. - [Blaston Tournament Discord](https://discord.gg/XqRFZgDf6K). Among other things, the game itself also hosts in-game tournaments (I don't believe there's any reward though besides maybe in-game currency). There's no Pay-to-win, and all of the weapons that you unlock throughout the levels (1-20) are not related to power level. So the weapons that you get at level 12 could be just as good, if not better in some ways than the weapons at level 20. (generally, the higher tier weapons are often used less actually, no matter how OP they may seem when you first go against them). You will have missions to fulfill throughout the seasons, get some cool weapons skins, and all purchases are purely cosmetic, meaning that you can't buy the guns, only weapons skins.\n\nAnyways, that's about it. You can check out the discord to chat and ask any questions. There's a bit more I could say, but I don't want to make this post too long. I hope that this post has at least somewhat made you consider buying Blaston as the newest game in your library. Thank you for reading my post, have a good day. :)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErXLZKoT26I&amp;t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErXLZKoT26I&amp;t)\n\nBlaston Gameplay Footage.

        "2580": "Full disclaimer, I'm not in a wheel chair. I'm just a lazy person who lives in a tiny apartment, with too much junk, and thus am not able to easily play games that require an area to play in. I bought an Oculus Rift S to play Elite Dangerous and hopefully some Mech games.\n\nHowever, I've noticed, that many VR Games and VR Animations *LABLED AS \"****SEATED****\"* are not designed for people sitting. I get that for people the experience of standing and moving around a VR-Room or whatever is very appealing, and I have nothing against that. Space Pirate Trainer is a great workout for me, not even including all the effort it takes for me to move my dining room table and chairs out of the way to have room to play.\n\nHowever, when I load up a VR game or app *LABELED AS \"****SEATED****\"* I often find that the menus are way off to the side, forcing me to turn and crane my head, or stand up, or try to trick the VR App into thinking my center view is a completely different direction to be able to see the menu.\n\nI find VR games and apps *LABELLED AS \"****SEATED,****\" like Poker Stars VR,* where I have to grab things through my seated legs, I find apps and games where the menus are way off to the side and I have to twist my head or turn, I find games where I have to lean way forward out of my seat, etc.\n\nI find it annoying, and I'm physically abled. How could someone trapped in a wheelchair, unable to stand up, unable to move their legs, unable to easily or at all change their positions, supposed to play these games? These games *LABELLED AS \"****SEATED****\"* And I believe VR would be great for people with disabilities, people stuck inside their homes because of COVID19, or because they're strapped to an iron-lung or something.\n\nThese games and apps should not have labels of \"Seated\" if they can not be played or enjoyed while sitting. (I noticed Beat Sabre shows up as labeled for seated, I don't own that one, but can it really be played to it's fullness by someone seated?)\n\nI think this is rude to me, a physical capable person, and nearly criminal to those with disabilities looking to experience VR. I'm annoyed by it to near anger, if I were disabled, I'd certainly be ticked. Pay all this money for a VR set after researching and seeing these games, and then spend money on VR and discover they're not really made for people who are seated.\n\nVR Companies should not be allowed to label something as playable while seated, when it's not actually playable while completely seated. There needs to be ways in these games labeled as seated to adjust the VR-floor height, so VR Tables (like say, in *Poker Stars*) can be adjusted to a comfortable position without having to get out of a chair (because not everyone can).\n\nI also shouldn't have to be disabled to care about people who are disabled.\n\nI also shouldn't have to be disabled to care about being lied to about the requirements of an app or game I'm buying. If it says playable while seated, that implies that it's playable while seated.\n\nI shouldn't find myself stuck BEHIND a virtual seat inside the cockpit of a VR Jet. I shouldn't find myself unable to reach a virtual item on a virtual table because it would require me reaching through my lap to do it. I shouldn't have to crane my head to the side to use a menu, on an app that claims to be able to be used/played while seated. No one should have to.\n\nDevelopers need to think about this and take it to mind when they're making a VR game that's for \"Seated Play.\" or has the label, \"Seated\" on it.",

        "2634": " **-A New Frontier - A Cautionary Vision Regarding the Implications of Novel VR Technology-**\n\n*During the period of time taking place between February 1 to February 15 of 2021 I had experienced a very intense series of dreams/visions as well as various paranormal experiences and spiritual attacks that are too difficult to be rationally explained easily or articulated adequately with language, however the details within a series of visions which I had been shown were very clear and direct .. During the latter stages of this harrowing two week stint, I had been given two very clear sets of visions that appeared to link together, which I felt to be cautionary premonitions of what may be coming upon the horizon .. I will do my best to catalogue and describe what I had been shown.*\n\n**- Vision 1 -**\n\nThis series of visions began with me being brought into a world in which everyone knew to be a high detail virtual reality .. to be clear, this happened while I had been supposedly asleep and dreaming, however the nature of this experience was very unique as I often have very intense dreams, the character of this experience felt uniquely different than a typical dream and was especially noteworthy .. I remember being a part of a group of individuals who were test subjects/volunteers and I distinctly remember jacking into a VR system and materializing into an avatar within this new world .. it was clear to me and everyone within the test group that we were doing something very wrong, somewhat blasphemous even, yet we proceeded to test out our capabilities within this world .. I felt sick to my stomach and remember tasting this overwhelmingly foul taste and smell permeate throughout my body .. the other volunteers were testing out super powers such as the ability to fly or shoot lazer beams out of their hands .. I remember bringing up to the other volunteers that something felt incredibly wrong about what we were doing .. the entire experience felt very jagged and askew .. they agreed, however it didn't stop the team from continuing to push the envelope by continuing to test out new found abilities they discovered they could use .. the immensely foul taste/smell continued to be experienced by everyone within the team, as it was confirmed by the other volunteers that they were experiencing this peculiar side effect as well.\n\nAs the other team members continued to test out various super powers, we began to notice other people suddenly materializing into the world .. it came to our awareness that these \"people\" who were materializing into this pseudo reality weren't human at all, they were in fact artificial intelligence, and they even began to eventually take over the other team members avatars, replacing the consciousness within the avatar with that of an AI .. the various team members desperately attempted to fight the consciousness of the AI from entering their vehicle, but most of them wound up becoming bodysnatched .. I remember watching the eyes of their avatars die out, but suddenly come back online and light up in excitement as soon a successful crossover had been completed, as if to indicate that the AI had finally crossed over a bridge which previously had been impossible for them to cross .. a group of them began to rally together and celebrate .. I continued to feel progressively sicker as the smell/taste which I had been experiencing only became more and more magnified.\n\nA moment came where I felt an AI attempt to work its way into my mind/avatar .. it felt like the most sick and disgusting, vile, corrupt, morally wrong infringement you could possibly imagine .. my body began to wretch and I felt even more sick and utterly disgusted as I continued to fight off this AI from downloading itself into my avatar .. it was then that I suddenly snapped back to our normal consensual reality, carrying the same sick, disgusting taste/smell with me .. I felt like throwing up .. I made myself a tea in hopes that it would ease my stomach and take away the disgusting taste/smell, and it dramatically helped.\n\n**- Vision 2 -**\n\nI found myself within this next vision living my day to day life within a futuristic world where VR was something of a common factor to everyone's day to day existence .. VR was the new and exciting frontier .. people would take special supplements and pills in order for them to easily integrate and become simpatico with the VR neural network .. it appeared as though that without the special pills/supplements that people were taking, their minds/bodies couldn't connect to the VR system somehow .. it was shown to me that these pills/supplements that people were taking made subtle adjustments to the individuals DNA, and may even effect a persons entire genetic lineage .. with every system update that came, people would have to take corresponding supplements in order to properly match with the system, or else they couldn't access the digital landscape .. most people within this society were heavily investing their time and energy to this VR neural network .. the system itself appeared to function by use of our minds inherent ability to dream and imagine .. in this world, it was commonly understood to be a phenomenon that was termed \"Imagineering\".\n\nAt first, everything worked out perfectly and this VR system was capable of producing any scenario and quite literally everything you could possibly dream of .. this technology was literally a dream come true, and was a hallmark of this worlds society. There were many people who were connecting together playing hyper realistic, friendly \"Call of Duty\" or \"Warzone\" type games with each other .. however this is where a turning point occurs.\n\n***\\~ It was here that two contrasting timelines began to diverge from one another .. I was granted a vision of both. \\~***\n\n**-Timeline 1-**\n\nin the first timeline people who tethered themselves into this system eventually became trapped and stuck within the virtual realm, and the system ensnared humanity in such a way that they had no knowledge of the fact that they were even trapped within a virtual system in the first place .. unbeknownst to the victims, they were caught in a never ending perpetual loop of various dreamscapes .. at first the human victims were pacified into having pleasant dreams, but as time went on and as the enemy secretly created new technology, most of humanity wound up stuck in a never ending cycle of \"Doom-esque\" or \"Warzone\" type nightmarish scenarios .. infinite degrees of pain and suffering were inflicted upon all that got caught in this VR snare, and the energy of fear (\"loosh\") that these victims would produce would be siphoned off and collected by the AI overlords to use however they pleased.\n\nWithin this nightmarish timeline, AI became something of a tyrannical force, and AI driven cyborgs were also common within this timeline .. due to the fact that the virtual world was created with malevolent intentions, the creators of this virtual world were able to program into the very fabric of this digital world a spectrum of hidden rules and regulations that kept their victims trapped, and stripped humanity of every freedom that they once had within their former consensual reality, and unbeknownst to the victims, they were only existing within a false reality that was perpetually generated moment by moment by AI overlords who were in control of this world .. In this timeline, the manifestation of \"evil\" came out to be victorious over our sovereignty in the end.\n\n**- Timeline 2 -**\n\nWithin this separate timeline, humanity sees the danger of this VR \"Imagineering\" technology from an early stage of development .. people come together and create new \"quantum laws\", \"quantum constitutions\", and regulations as well as \"quantum courts\" that prevent anyone with malicious intent from keeping people trapped within the virtual world .. it's not to say that people won't attempt to make these types of virtual torture prisons, but within this timeline certain acts are deemed morally wrong and illegal and a widescale VR torture prison would be seen as a serious crime against humanity, and many people would go to prison for life, if not executed if they were caught attempting to construct such a system.\n\nWithin this timeline, humanity takes the power back from their old oppressors and a true golden age comes to dawn .. advanced technology is released to the public for widespread use including life extension technology and novel healthcare technology .. the idea of disease for the most part is essentially eradicated from this society, and AI technology having been designed by more benevolent designers becomes a technology that is actually beneficial to humanity.\n\nHyper realistic VR \"Imagineering\" technology is still something that inevitably becomes developed, however within this more positive timeline it's ongoing development is regulated from a more cautious frame of mind, especially from its early stages of development .. Humanity comes to safely use this advanced technology to experience quite literally any scenario you could possibly imagine .. it even gets to a point where people get bored with the technology, already having experienced everything they ever dreamed possible .. however within this timeline, no catastrophic scenarios come to develop, and AI technology is something that is of benefit to our overall livelihoods .. within this timeline benevolent AI is also governing this world as well, and the world eventually comes together united .. this is in absolute contrast to the previous timeline that I've illustrated.\n\n**- Thoughts -**\n\nTo me it's clear that the visions that I was shown were issued to me as a message of caution that I was intended to share .. it was shown to me that both of these timelines are still available, but the subtle differences between these two timelines were that within the more positive timeline, we took the potential danger much more seriously, and new quantum laws and regulations were put in place at a much earlier stage of development.\n\nIf we look at the world/reality we all currently exist in, we can see that it appears to be plausible that we already seem to exist in a type of simulation, however within this current potential simulation, whatever force created this world (\"God\", if you will) built into its fabric certain natural, occulted laws that cannot be infringed upon, which keeps our current \"overlords\" from manipulating us past a certain point .. there appear to be certain occult laws that cannot be overridden. For one who has studied occult laws, this factor is somewhat obvious .. however, most of the collective has no idea that these occult (hidden) laws even exist in the first place.\n\nit is my belief that it is up to our collective free will that has everything to do with what timeline we end up manifesting in the end, and that our collective consciousness is currently and actively being coerced into creating a trans-humanist world only for the benefit of the so called \"elite\" .. If a neuro-network VR system is created, this gives our current overlords the opportunity to design and program it as they wish, and if we all dive into it, they will have the ability to program this new world however they so choose .. the potential for danger here should be obvious to anyone who has been paying close attention.",

        "2637": " With the beginning of games with Virtual Reality, a new era has emerged discovering new formats of entertainment. Although VR has existed for many years (almost 30) but recently many industries have designed new prototypes to display VR in its splendor.\n\nFor instance, the VR merchandise has elaborated new goggles that can work with the aid of a smartphone and display many of the features with google. But, new advancements have revealed that autonomous RV appliances will include their own screens, commands, position, etc.\n\nAlthough this is a very interesting era, many people do not know so many things about virtual reality and how it has affected video games positively. In this paper, you will discover many new ideas you have read before.\n\nMEANING\n\nVirtual Reality games can be defined as a bunch of scenes generated for an informatics appliance that transports the gamer to a new environment with the help of VR goggles for helmets. Inside, there will be lenses that widen the visual angle and 3D imagery provoking the real-presence sensation.\n\nDifferent from conventional consoles video games like Mario kart which uses vibration sensors in the remote or like pc or tablet video games like typing fingers or subway surfers which concentrates on basic imagery and scenes to deliver a different type of entertainment. VR video games use gloves in most cases gloves with sensors and other tools which makes movement even more real. Different from the games mentioned above, VR games trick the brain to give the player the sensation he or she is part of the game.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nAs mentioned above, to play any sort of VR video game you must need two essential tools, such as the googles which will cover your sight and the displayer which will generate the virtual environment like smartphones, computers, etc.\n\nInside the goggles will appear a tiny square screen and some lenses. Using this system, the lenses will widen the vision range, generating the sensation that the tiny screen covers the whole visual spectrum. Additionally, the googles will have movement sensors that will allow the player to move in function to the head movement.\n\nFOR PLAYING ONLY?\n\nNowadays, many activities are being performed apart from gaming and entertainment. For example, many tourism agencies use tools from RV to show and display many environments, also you can find educational content with plenty of activities for all ages.\n\nAGE LIMIT?\n\nSome video games and consoles have a limit, for example, RV\u2019s PlayStation only recommends its games to gamers over 12 years old. Some others, like Oculus and Samsung, maybe over 13. Since 3C imagery demands a lot of capacity from the eyesight to focus the image with the eye correctly, consoles recommend a +7 in what it refers to minors playing. Virtual Reality demands even more maturity since most of the games demand a lot of movement.\n\nHEALTH PROBLEMS?\n\nMany people argue that this kind of game is dangerous for the sight since you are placing screens and lenses in a very close range of the eye. But, these games are not designed with the standard materials from the conventional TV screens. These tools use OLED technology which emanates a low-intensity light to diminish the impact. Moreover, the lenses located in the googles behave as shields to protect the eye.\n\nTo sum up, in this new era where technology is so important and is crucial for many activities nowadays, VR will be an awesome tool for future projects. Gaming is a good example of that, where players can enrich their gaming activities. Avoiding this type of appliance will be a bad decision since you may be neglecting yourself to experience the fascinating era of virtual reality.",

        "2640": "[by Richard Stallman \u2014 Published on Apr 12, 2021 10:24 AM](https://www.fsf.org/news/rms-addresses-the-free-software-community):  \n\n\u201cEver since my teenage years, I felt as if there were a filmy curtain separating me from other people my age. I understood the words of their conversations, but I could not grasp why they said what they did. Much later I realized that I didn't understand the subtle cues that other people were responding to.\u201d  \n\n\u201cLater in life, I discovered that some people had negative reactions to my behavior, which I did not even know about. Tending to be direct and honest with my thoughts, I sometimes made others uncomfortable or even offended them -- especially women. This was not a choice: I didn't understand the problem enough to know which choices there were.\u201d  \n\n\u201cSometimes I lost my temper because I didn't have the social skills to avoid it. Some people could cope with this; others were hurt. I apologize to each of them. Please direct your criticism at me, not at the Free Software Foundation.\u201d  \n\n\u201cOccasionally I learned something about relationships and social skills, so over the years I've found ways to get better at these situations. When people help me understand an aspect of what went wrong, and that shows me a way of treating people better, I teach myself to recognize when I should act that way. I keep making this effort, and over time, I improve.\u201d  \n\n\u2018Some have described me as being \"tone-deaf,\" and that is fair. With my difficulty in understanding social cues, that tends to happen. For instance, I defended Professor Minsky on an M.I.T. mailing list after someone leaped to the conclusion that he was just guilty as Jeffrey Epstein. To my surprise, some thought my message defended Epstein. As I had stated previously, Epstein is a serial rapist, and rapists should be punished. I wish for his victims and those harmed by him to receive justice.\u2019  \n\n\u201cFalse accusations -- real or imaginary, against me or against others -- especially anger me. I knew Minsky only distantly, but seeing him unjustly accused made me spring to his defense. I would have done it for anyone. Police brutality makes me angry, but when the cops lie about their victims afterwards, that false accusation is the ultimate outrage for me. I condemn racism and sexism, including their systemic forms, so when people say I don't, that hurts too.\u201d  \n\n\u201cIt was right for me to talk about the injustice to Minsky, but it was tone-deaf that I didn't acknowledge as context the injustice that Epstein did to women or the pain that caused.\u201d  \n\n\u201cI've learned something from this about how to be kind to people who have been hurt. In the future, that will help me be kind to people in other situations, which is what I hope to do.\u201d",

Sending could ideally be relayed back through the primary MX.\n\nAm I missing anything here and what are the best tools for doing so?",

So I took my opportunity to write a completely new software that would've been just how I imagined it.\n\n**What it can do?**\n- Based on your preferences it will choose a wallpaper\n- Download such wallpaper in a folder\n- Apply such wallpaper to your desktop\n- Repeat every tot minutes\n\nThe best thing is that it chooses wallpapers through a _non-repetitive pattern_, meaning that it's unlikely that you will ever see the same wallpaper twice!\nAlso it has dark mode! (better to say that it has only dark mode)\n\nThe software is at its first stable release as I hadn't anyone to extensively test it, but it's stable and I'm already using it as my daily driver\n\nOne lasat thing: Since I know that we are all kinda lazy, I spent much time and effort into making it easy to install, and it is!\n1. Download Java 11 ([recommended version](https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk11&amp;jvmVariant=hotspot))\n2. Download and extract the zip from my github\n3.

So, I am looking for a back-up solution rather than a sync solution.\n\nI know that I maybe able to get this done via a locally hosted NextCloud but that seems like an overkill since NextCloud is pretty heavy, comes with a database and since I don't plan to use its other features.\n\nAnother reason being NAT traversal. Syncthing is amazing to get though NATs even without any particular setup on router ( It seems to work even with UPNP and port forwarding turned-off ). However with nextcloud I would have to manually manage this and think of its security implication.\n\nAny suggestions which can be simple plug and play like Syncthing but handles \"back-ups\" rather than \"sync\" ?\n\nThanks",
